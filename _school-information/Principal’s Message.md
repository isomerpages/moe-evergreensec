Foreword to students

**Year of rejuvenation**  
  
Welcome back to school!  
  
The theme for the year 2022 – rejuvenation – signifies a time for us to refresh and reinvigorate ourselves.  
  
Like how spring ushers in the growth of new beginnings, we look forward to a year of new areas of growth.

I shall suggest two key goals we can all adopt as we start the new year. 

**Build strong and positive relationships**  
  
As we begin the year, let us endeavour to build strong relationships with those around us.  
  
We can do so by getting to know and reaching out to others in our class, CCA, home, and community.  
  
Bring cheer to those around by making them feel accepted and important. Come together to brainstorm for ideas to make your class and CCA a safe and happy place where everyone can learn and grow in. As we embark on our Values-In-Action projects, empathise with others and be creative in the ways you bring about positive changes in their lives.   
  
Remember all of us have our unique set of strengths.  A good place to start is to revisit our **S**trengthsfinder or **S**trengthsexplorer profiles. Hone our strengths as we contribute. In our words and deeds, we can lift others up and enable them to live out their strengths. We can certainly make a difference in big and small ways!  
  
**Cultivate a curious mind**  
  
Learning is an exciting endeavour. Every one of us can certainly learn, and learn well.  
  
We can start by cultivating a curious mind, as we seize every opportunity to learn and grow.  
  
Albert Einstein had this to say about curiosity:  
  
_“The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvellous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries to comprehend only a little of this mystery every day.”  
_  
So as we go into every class, or take part in any learning experience, be curious.  Do not stop questioning.  Be in awe of the world around as we learn more about it each day in our lessons, and through our diverse schooling experiences. Be patient with yourself but do be determined to learn “a little” every day.  
  
May we continue to live out our school mission. Let us “develop a passion to contribute and excel”.  
  
I wish you a wonderful year of rejuvenation ahead!

Mr Vincent Toh
