**(G)     Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

**_1\._**     **"_Is DSA for my child_?_"_**

You can read this [MOE Schoolbag article "Is DSA for Your Child?"](https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/is-dsa-for-your-child) to glean some ideas. The article features Evergreen Sec's HOD PE & CCA Mr James Ng, who answered some common questions such as "Who should apply for DSA?" and "What is the selection process for DSA like?".

**_2\._**     **_"Do students need to have prior achievements in the talent area to qualify for DSA?"_**

Some experience would be sufficient, but achievements are a bonus. At Evergreen, we are open to taking in students who do not have experience in a specific sport. For example, we know that Rugby, which is one of our DSA talent areas, is not a very common sport and not many students would have the chance to take it up formally. So, we assess their potential for Rugby through other sports that they have participated in before and look at their reflexes and physical ability to see they are suitable.

Our school also offers DSA in the areas of Leadership and Languages. There aren’t many formal achievements for these areas, so we would usually look at the kind of activities the applicants were involved in.

**_3\._**     **"_Can a student apply for more than one DSA category?"_**

Yes, a student may apply to up to 2 talent areas in each school.

However, if an applicant does receive a Confirmed Offer (CO), he/she will receive an offer in only one DSA category.

**_4.    "Is there a minimum PSLE score that an applicant must attain, even if he/she has been_** **_given_** **_a Confirmed Offer?"_**

Students given a CO are guaranteed a place in the school, provided that they accept the offer and qualify for an academic course offered by the school i.e. Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) based on their PSLE results.

**_5.  "What does my child need to provide during the application, for either mainstream or non-mainstream applicants?"_**
