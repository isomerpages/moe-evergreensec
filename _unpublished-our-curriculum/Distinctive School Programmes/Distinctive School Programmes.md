Applied Learning Programme

The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) –  Effective  Communicators with a  Heart – is a three-year  programme  which  leverages  on  real-world  contexts  to develop values, communication, creative and critical thinking. It seeks to groom confident leaders with effective communication skills and a strong sense of purpose to serve for the greater good.

We are also one of four schools offering the Enhanced ALP (Mother Tongue Languages). Over a 3-year curriculum, Chinese and Malay Language students are exposed to range of experiences to help them apply and develop a deeper appreciation of their Mother Tongue.

Learning for Life Programme

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in EVG is a 4/5-year programme that focuses on Strengthening Resilience, Character and Leadership through Sports Education in all students. A 3-tier approach is adopted, ranging from school-wide programmes to specific interest or ability groups. With this programme, we aim to nurture all our students to become thinking and caring leaders who take personal responsibility for maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle.
