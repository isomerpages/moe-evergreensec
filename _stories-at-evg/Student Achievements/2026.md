<p>We celebrate the achievements of the Class of 2025! This milestone marks
the culmination of intensive effort and personal sacrifices by EVGians,
backed up by the strong support of their parents as well as the dedication
of our teachers who guided, encouraged and believed in them throughout
this journey. While each EVGian’s outcome is different, all of them stand
on the threshold of new pathways whether to junior colleges, polytechnics,
ITE or other meaningful opportunities. These results do not mark an end,
but the beginning of many promising journeys ahead. Congratulations to
all of you!</p>
