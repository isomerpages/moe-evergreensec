<p>The Humanities Department had organised a Cultural Immersion Overseas
Learning Journey (OLJ) for a group of Secondary 3 students to Seoul, South
Korea, from 3 November to 9 November 2024. The OLJ provided opportunities
for students to reach out to the world and bring in new perspectives and
new connections to enrich their learning experiences.</p>
