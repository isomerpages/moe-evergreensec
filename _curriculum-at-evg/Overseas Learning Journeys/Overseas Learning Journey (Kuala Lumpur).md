From 19th - 22nd June, travelled to Kuala Lumpur for an Overseas Learning Journey.

During the trip, our students had the privilege of visiting Breadtalk, where they had the chance to delve into the intricacies of running a franchise. 

Additionally, the students also had an unforgettable experience in Sekinchan, where they took part in traditional rice planting. This hands-on experience allowed them to gain a deep understanding of the country's rich agricultural heritage, fostering an appreciation for traditional farming practices.

The itinerary included visits to Royal Selangor, Sinchew Daily, and Universiti Malaya. At each location, our students had the opportunity to engage with industry professionals, gaining valuable insights into their respective fields and broadening their knowledge beyond the classroom.

The journey culminated in a visit to SMJK Yuhua (Secondary School), where students participated in an interactive morning filled with performances, bonding activities and games. This proved to be a great opportunity for students of both schools to bond with one another, fostering new friendships and creating lasting memories.

This enriching experience provided our students with a unique opportunity to broaden their horizons and undoubtedly served as a platform for personal growth, cultivating a sense of global awareness and cultural appreciation.
