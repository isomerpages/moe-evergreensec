From 30 May to 2 June 2023, our Secondary 3 Malay Language students travelled to Jakarta for the Sec 3 Cultural Immersion Overseas Learning Journey.

The objectives of the learning journey are for our EVGians to:

a) develop self-management, social awareness & interpersonal skills.

b) learn the values of respect, commitment, responsibility and care through their interaction with each other and with the hosts

c) to be exposed to different cultures and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world

d) strengthen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore

During their 4 day OLJ, our EVGians immersed themselves in rich and meaningful experiences. These included 

i) a visit to the National Museum Gajah Mada

ii) a school immersion experience at Sekolah Alam Indonesia, a Jakarta-based local green school whose curriculum is centred on Problem-Based and Collaborative Learning

iii) a visit to a Singaporean startup, PT Kinobi Technologies Indonesia. 

iv) a visit to the Textile Museum, where our EVGians had the opportunity to create Batik pieces

v) a visit to Taman Mini Indonesia (Visit Mini Indonesia Park)
