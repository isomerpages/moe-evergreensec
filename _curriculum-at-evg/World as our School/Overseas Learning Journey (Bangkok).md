During the last week of the June holidays, a group of Secondary 3 students embarked on a journey to Bangkok for a Cultural Immersion Outdoor Learning Journey.

The OLJ aims to

1\. Develop self-management, social awareness & interpersonal skills

2\. Learn the values of respect, commitment, responsibility and care through their interaction with each other and with the hosts

3\. Expose students to a different culture and from Singapore's culture and sensitise them to this culture

4\. Strengthen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore

We are especially delighted to be back in Bangkok to visit Tepleela School which we had ties with since 2016, but was discontinued due to the pandemic. 

Indeed, through this visit we were able to foster the good relationship that we once had with our Thai counterparts. We were once again treated to exceptional Thai hospitality and a warm welcome. In addition, Tepleela school also had prepared a number of activities so that the students would be able to better appreciate the Thai culture and customs.

Our EVGians also visited museums and other places of interest to immerse themselves in activities to understand and appreciate the Thai efforts at sustaining their culture and the environment.
