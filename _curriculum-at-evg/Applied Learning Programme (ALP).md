<p>Effective Communicators With a Heart</p>
<p>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) –&nbsp; Effective&nbsp;
Communicators with a&nbsp; Heart – is a three-year&nbsp; programme&nbsp;
which&nbsp; leverages&nbsp; on&nbsp; real-world&nbsp; contexts&nbsp; to
develop values, communication skills, and creative and critical thinking.
It seeks to groom confident leaders with effective communication skills,
the ability to express themselves clearly and creatively, and a strong
sense of purpose to harness these skills to serve for the greater good.</p>

<p>In the present run, the English ALP is closely aligned with the English
Language curriculum. The Secondary 1 Drama Programme focuses on the foundational
skillsets of clarity in self-expression. The Secondary 2 Forum Theatre
programme aims to develop students’ capacity for empathy as well as analytical
and critical thinking, through the interactivity offered by Forum Theatre.
Secondary 3 students undergo an intensive focus on effective presentation
skills, honing their communication skills in order to speak persuasively,
and with purpose. Authentic platforms to apply their skills are deliberately
created in the students’ Service Learning Projects.</p>

<p>Evergreen Secondary School is also one of four schools in the whole of
Singapore offering the Enhanced ALP in Mother Tongue Languages. Over a
three-year curriculum, Chinese and Malay Language students are exposed
to a range of experiences and cultural exposure programmes to help them
develop a deeper appreciation of their Mother Tongue.</p>

<p>Students with strengths in communication skills are then given developmental
avenues through participating in public speaking activities and hosting
school-based activities, as well as participating in prestigious competitions
such as national debate competitions, storytelling competitions and the
Model United Nations. They also work closely with the school’s kNOW programme
to present general knowledge and current affairs issues to the school population.</p>
<p>Another area of ALP that is unique to the school is our Music programme,
which aims to develop and recognise students’ musical talents. Students
go through a rich Lower Secondary Music curriculum which develops their
musicality and songwriting skills, and those who show a keen interest are
then grown through talent development programmes and representation at
various music events and competitions both in and outside school.</p>

<p>Together, the EVG ALP gives every student, regardless of his or her academic
course, a strong foundation and a competitive edge in expressing themselves
effectively beyond the walls of the classroom.</p>
