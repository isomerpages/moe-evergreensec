###### Key Learning Experiences in Lower Secondary
*   **Culinary Lessons**:
Secondary 1 and 2 students are exposed to a range of skills and cooking methods to prepare a variety of dishes. The skills learned allow them to create interesting and appetising dishes as part of their Project work.
*   **Healthy Eating Week**: This whole-school event is led by our Secondary 2 students to emphasise the importance of good nutrition for a healthy lifestyle. They do this through posters and games on different topics assigned to them such as ‘Choose Wholegrains’ and ‘Eat your Dark Green Vegetables’. The students have the opportunity to present their posters and games during recess time. This event is well-received by students and staff alike as they enjoy the fun and creative games. Our students are also able to consolidate their learning of the FCE syllabus through this activity.

###### Key Learning Experiences in Upper Secondary
*   **Culinary Skills**: A variety of skills are taught to the students when they are in Secondary 3 to equip them with the ability to create skillful and interesting dishes for their practical examinations. Secondary 3 students also have the opportunity to attend a culinary course conducted by a professional chef where they are able to learn more advanced skills as well as food presentation techniques.
*   **Food Science Experiments**: Through experiments, students are able to see the science behind cooking and thus are able to understand the different reactions which happen during food preparation and cooking.
