#### **Art**
###### Key Learning Experiences in Lower Secondary
* **Paper Relief Sculpture Project**

* **Photoshop**  
The Secondary Two Art students learned how to use Photoshop software to demonstrate their understanding of elements of art and principles of design.

###### Key Learning Experiences in Upper Secondary
* **Introduction to Installation Art**  
The Secondary Three Art students were challenged to produce mini-installation pieces that transcended their daily experiences into visual metaphors. Dialogues on artmaking are an integral part of their development as confident artists when they present their works to their friends during the critique session. ![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Aesthetics,%20Design%20Technology/Art/Upper%20Secondary/U1.jpg)

* **Identity Project**  
The theme of Identity provided an opportunity for students to be introspective learners as they reflected and made sense of their place in this world through interpretations of themselves. ![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Aesthetics,%20Design%20Technology/Art/Upper%20Secondary/U2.jpg)

#### **Design and Technology (DNT)**
###### Key Learning Experiences in Lower Secondary
* **Design Project**  
Our lower secondary programme is implemented in two semesters in a year. The first semester is for the Secondary One and the second semester is for the Secondary Two students. Students need to do research and include elements of Singapore’s identity into the designs of their projects. Through this Lower Secondary programme, students will have opportunities to show their creativity in their designs, learn technology topics and go through the whole design process. ![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Aesthetics,%20Design%20Technology/Design%20&%20Technology/Lower%20Secondary/L1.png)

###### Key Learning Experiences in Upper Secondary
* **Design Project**  
For the Upper Secondary Programme, Design & Technology is offered to the Normal Academic and Express stream students. D&T is a coursework-based subject where students are taught how to do problem-solving through intensive research, tackling their identified problems and solving them through design and make. A theme will be given each year and students have to design their projects relating to the theme.
* **Building Design Skills Workshop**  
Students get the opportunity to attend workshops in Polytechnics, where they get to learn the full suite of topics related to design such as sketching, rendering, soft material modelling, software exposure and 3D printing exposure. ![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Aesthetics,%20Design%20Technology/Design%20&%20Technology/Upper%20Secondary/U1.png)

###### Key Learning Experiences
* **EVG's P.R.I.S.M Programme (Powering Real-World Interdisciplinary Student Music Experiences)**  
Here at Evergreen Secondary, students automatically join a two (mandatory) + two (optional) year in-house Programme (PRISM) that develops students into songwriters, singers and critical thinkers. Opportunities are given for students to develop their&nbsp;music&nbsp;craft and a robust in-house two-year GMP programme is dedicated to helping them achieve a basic ability to write songs on their own.

* **EVG's Your Voice! Songwriting Programme**  
Songwriting rewards immensely. When students get the opportunity to craft their own song from scratch, the fulfilling experience convinces them that there is joy in learning.&nbsp;A song done well creates a strong sense of ownership and belief in the inherent value of the student’s voice. For many, it uncovers hidden talents that leads to a daring entrepreneurial spirit.

#### **Nutrition & Food Science (NFS)**
###### Key Learning Experiences in Lower Secondary
*   **Culinary Lessons**  
Secondary 1 and 2 students are exposed to a range of skills and cooking methods to prepare a variety of dishes. The skills learned allow them to create interesting and appetising dishes as part of their Project work.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Aesthetics,%20Design%20Technology/Nutrition%20And%20Food%20Science/Lower%20Secondary/picture6.jpg)
*   **Healthy Eating Week**  
This whole-school event is led by our Secondary 2 students to emphasise the importance of good nutrition for a healthy lifestyle. They do this through posters and games on different topics assigned to them such as ‘Choose Wholegrains’ and ‘Eat your Dark Green Vegetables’. The students have the opportunity to present their posters and games during recess time. This event is well-received by students and staff alike as they enjoy the fun and creative games. Our students are also able to consolidate their learning of the FCE syllabus through this activity.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Aesthetics,%20Design%20Technology/Nutrition%20And%20Food%20Science/picture4.png)
