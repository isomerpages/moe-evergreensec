### **Geography**
Geography students in Evergreen Secondary School are exposed to Geographical Inquiry (GI), whereby they are required to gather data, analyse and interpret their findings and make evaluations based on the collated information. In the process, they gain geographical insights and develop skills in communicating and applying geographical knowledge. 

**Key Learning Experiences**  
* **Secondary 1 Water Quality GI**  
Our Secondary 1 students are given the opportunity to investigate the water quality around the school.  Groups of students presented and shared their findings to their peers.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Humanities%20Department/Geography/water%20quality.jpg)

* **Secondary 3 Climate and Weather GI**  
Secondary 3 students constructed a few hypothesis on microclimate and tested their hypotheses by collecting weather data around the school compound. Using the collated information, they supported or rejected their proposed hypothesis.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Humanities%20Department/Geography/climate%20and%20weather%20gi.jpg)

* **Secondary 4 Tourism GI**  
Our Secondary 4 students applied the fieldwork techniques to conduct an investigation on Kampong Glam. With the help of ICT, students worked collaboratively to collect, analyse and interpret collected data. The groups of students shared their data, analysis and evaluation with their peers.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Humanities%20Department/Geography/tourism%20gi.jpg)

#### **History**
**Key Learning Experiences**  
* **Secondary 2 Investigation History: Singapore under the Japanese Occupation 1942 – 1945**  
History students embarked on a learning journey at the Former Ford Motor Factory where they acquired and interpreted relevant historical sources that will help them construct knowledge and understanding of the past.  

  This was the place where the British forces surrendered unconditionally to the Imperial Japanese Army on 15 February 1942. The exhibition presents the events and memories surrounding the British surrender, the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, and the legacies of the war. Through oral history accounts, archival records and published materials, the exhibition highlights the diverse experiences of people in Singapore during this crucial time in our history.

  During the Learning Journey, students examined and collected a variety of sources, written, oral, pictorial or artefact, to have a deeper understanding of how people’s lives were affected by the Japanese Occupation in Singapore. We have also included a few thinking questions in our HI booklet to help our students engage with the sources in a more critical and meaningful manner.  

  Together in their groups, they pooled together their sources, discussed and carefully selected the most relevant sources to illustrate the lives of the people in a poster. A short extract was also included to tell the story on how the people in Singapore lived through the Japanese Occupation.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Humanities%20Department/History/history%20group.jpg)
