### **Geography**
Geography students in Evergreen Secondary School are exposed to Geographical Inquiry (GI), whereby they are required to gather data, analyse and interpret their findings and make evaluations based on the collated information. In the process, they gain geographical insights and develop skills in communicating and applying geographical knowledge. 

**Key Learning Experiences**  
**Secondary 1 Water Quality GI**  
Our Secondary 1 students are given the opportunity to investigate the water quality around the school.  Groups of students presented and shared their findings to their peers.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Humanities%20Department/Geography/water%20quality.jpg)

**Secondary 3 Climate and Weather GI**  
Secondary 3 students constructed a few hypothesis on microclimate and tested their hypotheses by collecting weather data around the school compound. Using the collated information, they supported or rejected their proposed hypothesis.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Humanities%20Department/Geography/climate%20and%20weather%20gi.jpg)
