* **Reading Programme**  
Chinese Unit launched the Reading Programme with the Secondary One and Two students this year.  Through this programme, we hope to cultivate the habit of reading in our students, enable them to find enjoyment and widen their perspective through reading. Teachers have developed learning packages in SLS that will promote critical thinking in students thereby enriching students’ reading experiences. Through the interactive activities in SLS and discussion in class, students communicate and express their thought confidently with their peers. Students has also participated a series of interesting activities on School Book Day (校园书香日), including taking part in prized pop quizzes sessions, introducing their favourite books and receiving books as gifts from school.

Numerous activities were organised and renowned local writers were invited to schools to promote a love and appreciation of literature among students. The school is honoured to invite local writer Mr Quek Yong Siu (郭永秀) to share his passion of writing with our students.

In 2022, Chinese Unit has organized a virtual learning journey to Beijing and Tianjin in November. In this learning journey, students were able to explore attractions like The Great Wall of China, The Forbidden City and the Singapore-Sino project in Tianjin Eco-city virtually.  With the help of a local guide, students were able to learn interesting historical facts associated with these heritage sites. Different from that of last year, students had the opportunity gain a better understanding on the rapid technological development in China.
