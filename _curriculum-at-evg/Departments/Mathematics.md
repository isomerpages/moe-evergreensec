#### **Mathematics**

The Mathematics Department has a cohesive team of Mathematics teachers, working closely together and being supportive of one another in order to bring out the best in our students. We take pride in creating success stories and have expectations to meet high standards of performance.

**Key Learning Experiences**

* **Singapore Math Olympiad (SMO) and Singapore Asian Math Olympiad (SASMO) Competitions**  
Annually, the department organises training workshops for passionate students who are interested in competitive mathematics. As an extra-curricular activity, the training workshop stimulates purposeful discussions amongst the students as well as prepares them with higher-order problem-solving heuristics. The topics discussed do not just complement the MOE Mathematics syllabus, they also develop the studentsâ€™ creative thinking skills and deepen their understanding of certain concepts. From Secondary 2, students also take part in the SMO and SASMO competitions. Our strengths lie in giving students numerous opportunities to demonstrate their passion for mathematics.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/Mathematics%20Department/jpeg%20image%2019.jpeg)

Within the school curriculum, our students are always yearning for more and eager for challenges. Hence, all Secondary Three G3 students take Additional Mathematics as a subject. As a Full-SBB pilot school, many of our students also take up cross-level Mathematics at a higher level across all the levels.
