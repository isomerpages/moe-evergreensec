#### **English Language**

**Key Learning Experiences**  
* **Applied Learning Programme**  
Evergreen Secondary’s ALP is the signature Communication Skills & Inventive Thinking Programme that focuses on values, communication, creative and critical thinking using the real-world context. Through the EVG Communication Programme, we aim to nurture all our students to become confident leaders, possessing effective communication skills and a sense of purpose.In this way, we hope to enable every EVGian to Aspire & Achieve and be inspired to contribute actively to Singapore and the wider community.

* **Secondary One ALP - Readers Theatre**  
Our English ALP programme has begun for all our Secondary One students. This year, our students will be going through a new Readers’ Theatre Programme, where they will learn how to express themselves in a clear and articulate manner through dramatised reading. The programme kicked off with drama activities such as freeze frames and body props, and students also got the chance to start reading their scripts aloud. They will then work towards staging a Readers’ Theatre performance while still observing the necessary safe management measures. We are truly looking forward to watch the culmination of all their hard work in Term 2!

* **Secondary Two ALP - Readers Theatre**  
We use forum theatre – where actors and spectators are part of the performance – to teach empathy. Students first act out a dramatisation of scenes with characters trying to resolve conflict with each other. For example, an elderly man and a young passenger fighting for a seat on a bus. Next, the class is invited to propose alternative storylines to the scene, sometimes with students jumping in to replace their friends on stage, acting out the new scenarios. Later on, students will be tasked to tell their own stories as they stage scripts on the themes of “Community” and “School”.

* **Secondary Three ALP - Group Presentation Skills Programme**  
The Secondary 3 students undergo an intensive focus in effective presentation skills, honing their communication skills in order to speak persuasively, and with purpose. This in-house programme also provides authentic platforms for students to apply their skills through their VIA project presentations and cohort-wide showcases.

* **Sec 3 EL Learning Journey**  
To foster greater appreciation in the arts, all Sec 4 and 5 students get the opportunity to attend a theatre performance every year.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/English%20Department/sec%203%20alp.jpeg)


#### **Literature**

Evergreen Secondary School believes in igniting a passion for Literature and bolstering students’ confidence in the subject. The school supports students in pursuing Literature at upper secondary by offering the subject to both Express and Normal Academic students and providing a rigorous and engaging lower secondary programme. Many of our students express that studying Literature is a unique experience no other subject is able to give.

**Key Learning Experiences**  
* **Workshops, Theatrical Productions & Festivals**  
Our vibrant Literature programmes ensure that students at all levels delve deep into literary works and are given avenues to express themselves dramatically as well as artistically. Specially designed workshops and opportunities to watch theatrical productions are critical aspects of our programme, and the National Schools Literature Festival is a key event that our students and teachers eagerly await every year. We believe it is extremely important for our students to witness and be among the wider community of Literature enthusiasts in Singapore.

* **Poetry**  
The highlight of Evergreen’s Literature programme is an emphasis on poetry which includes a thematic approach to Singapore poetry culminating in a learning journey to a complementary part of the country. We feel an experiential approach to the subject is vital to ensuring that students appreciate its relevance to their lives. 

  At Evergreen Secondary, we are convinced that introducing Literature well and inspiring through it will leave a lasting impact on its future and all of ours.![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/Departments/English%20Department/shakespeare%20exhibition.jpg)
