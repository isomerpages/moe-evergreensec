Secondary One ALP - Readers Theatre

Our English ALP programme has begun for all our Secondary One students. This year, our students will be going through a new Readers’ Theatre Programme, where they will learn how to express themselves in a clear and articulate manner through dramatised reading. The programme kicked off with drama activities such as freeze frames and body props, and students also got the chance to start reading their scripts aloud. They will then work towards staging a Readers’ Theatre performance while still observing the necessary safe management measures. We are truly looking forward to watch the culmination of all their hard work in Term 2!

Secondary Two ALP - Readers Theatre

We use forum theatre – where actors and spectators are part of the performance – to teach empathy.

Students first act out a dramatisation of scenes with characters trying to resolve conflict with each other. For example, an elderly man and a young passenger fighting for a seat on a bus.

Next, the class is invited to propose alternative storylines to the scene, sometimes with students jumping in to replace their friends on stage, acting out the new scenarios.

Later on, students will be tasked to tell their own stories as they stage scripts on the themes of “Community” and “School”.

Every March, the English Department organises a week-long event to celebrate the English language and to get students and staff to develop a greater sense of appreciation of English Language &amp; Literature through fun and educational activities, like concert performances, panel discussions and language games.

Students are encouraged to read widely so as to promote a love for reading. The Literature programme provides a sound foundation for a possible extension of this subject at higher levels.

**Drama Skills**  
Students are taught drama skills to help them understand aspects of literary study such as characterisation, setting, mood and atmosphere.

Role-playing during the Sec 2 Drama Workshop

**Creative Writing Skills**  
Students are encouraged to explore the creation of literary works to find their personal voice, such as by composing original poems.

**Why Study Literature?**

*   The study of Literature both sharpens and broadens students’ minds. The critical thinking skills uniquely offered by Literature include:
    *   cultivating a questioning mind;
    *   exploring personal and social issues; and
    *   interrogating and managing ambiguities and multiple perspectives.
*   It develops empathy and stimulates thinking about beliefs and values.
*   It builds in students socio-cultural sensitivity and awareness, as well as a global outlook.
