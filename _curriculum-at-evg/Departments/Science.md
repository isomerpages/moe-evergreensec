<h4><strong>Science </strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department is committed to cultivating scientifically literate,
critical, and innovative thinkers who are equipped to navigate and contribute
to a rapidly evolving world. Through engaging students in real-world applications,
STEM-focused learning, and collaborative inquiry, we inspire curiosity
and problem-solving skills in every student. By leveraging industry partnerships,
interdisciplinary learning, and emerging technologies, we nurture responsible
decision-makers who think creatively, communicate effectively, and work
collaboratively to address complex challenges in Science and beyond.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our students’ key learning experiences are categorised into three tiers:</p>

<p><u>Key Learning Experiences</u>
</p>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary Project Work</strong>
</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) provides all Secondary 2 students
with an exciting platform to connect their learning across subjects through
hands-on, real-world experiences. The programme encourages creativity,
curiosity, and collaboration as students apply their knowledge in science,
mathematics, and design to solve authentic problems. Through IPW, our students
don’t just learn, they experiment, innovate, and discover the joy of turning
ideas into reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Exploring Through Slime Making</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the most memorable IPW experiences for our students is making slime.
Through this activity, students explore how different substances interact
to form polymers, learning about viscosity, states of matter, and the properties
of materials in a hands-on way.</p>

<p><strong>Innovating with Solar Energy Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>Moving beyond experiments, students take on design challenges that address
real-world issues using solar energy. They brainstorm and prototype innovative
ideas such as solar-powered fans, lamps, or devices that improve daily
life sustainably. This project nurtures not only scientific understanding
of energy transformation but also empathy and social awareness, as students
consider how technology can be used for the greater good. By working collaboratively,
they learn to plan, communicate, and refine their prototypes, much like
young engineers in the making.</p>

<p>Through these IPW experiences, our students develop essential 21st-century
skills, critical and inventive thinking, collaboration and communication.
They learn that science is not confined to textbooks but is a powerful
tool for discovery and innovation. IPW nurtures confident, curious learners
who are eager to explore how knowledge can make a difference in the world
around them.</p>

<p><strong>Science Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Astrigue</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our students participated in <em>Astrigue</em>, an astronomy competition
organised by Raffles Institution (Junior College Section) to inspire passion
and promote interest in the field of astronomy. The preliminary stage of
the competition involved a Poster project and an MCQ test. The 4 highest
scoring teams were then selected to participate in the finals, which featured
a game of jeopardy and a rapid response round.</p>
<p>The team comprising Harshini Vatsavai, Isabella Tee, Jessie Loh and Lim
Yu Tong (front row) from 3 Dynamic qualified for the final round and eventually
placed 3rd runner-up! In addition, the team comprising Aqilah Jeffridin
from 3 Integrity as well as Heng Yu Ruo, Edvard Chan and Qaisara Nur Afiqah
from 3 Dynamic (second row) received special mention for their poster on
constellation mythology.</p>

<p><strong><em>Illustratum</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Five teams from our school took part in <em>Illustratum</em>, a prestigious
science communication competition organised by the NUS Department of Physics,
at the National University of Singapore. The student participants are Ying
En (3 Integrity), Yao En (3 Respect), Jiaxuan (3 Respect), Kee Rwee (3
Respect), Ren Zhen (3 Respect), Garrett (3 Integrity), Rui Jie (3 Respect),
Kai Wen (3 Respect), Jason (3 Respect), Coco (3 Integrity), Cheryl (3 Integrity),
Syrius (3 Respect), Aiden (3 Respect) and Ziqi (3 Respect).</p>
<p>The event provides a platform for students to explore and present physics
concepts in innovative and engaging ways, encouraging creativity, critical
thinking, and clarity in scientific communication. Our students showcased
projects based on the applications of electromagnetism, stability, sound,
aerodynamics, and vortex. We are proud to share that four out of the five
teams received the <em>Merit Award</em>, recognising their strong grasp
of Physics principles and their effective presentation skills. Through
this experience, students had the opportunity to be independent explorers
and learners, working under the mentorship of NUS Physics faculty and the
supervision of teachers from the school. Their outstanding performance
reflects the school’s commitment to nurturing curiosity, scientific inquiry,
and excellence in learning.</p>

<p><strong><em>Knowgets Creative Lab</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our students participated in Knowgets Creative Lab, organised by Holy
Innocents’ High School in collaboration with the Media Design for Learning
Branch (MDL) of ETD. Centred on the theme “STEM in Everyday Life,” the
programme allowed students to explore Science Centre Singapore’s exhibitions
and create digital media products that explain scientific principles behind
daily phenomena. Through this experience, our students honed their creativity,
collaboration, and digital literacy skills while discovering how science
and technology shape the world around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SISTEMIC</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Evergreen students proudly represented the school at Singapore International
STEM Innovation Challenge (SISTEMIC), a six-day international STEM summit
organised by the MOE and National Junior College. Themed “Life Reimagined
– Exploring Emerging Technologies,” the summit brought together students
aged 15–18 from around the world to tackle real-world challenges through
innovation, collaboration, and design thinking. Participants explored the
social, economic and ethical impacts of technologies such as artificial
intelligence, biotechnology, renewable energy, and space exploration.</p>
<p>The Voyager teams collaborated with peers from international schools in
masterclasses, learning journeys, and the STEM Innovation Challenge. They
designed and presented solutions for issues such as sustainable energy
and conscious consumption — demonstrating outstanding scientific reasoning
and innovative thinking. We are thrilled to share that Team Evergreen clinched
the Gold and Silver Awards in the Voyager Programme, a testament to our
students’ creativity, perseverance, and teamwork on the global stage.</p>

<p><strong>High School STEM Internship @ Abbott Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>Our student, Carlo from 4 Respect, experienced a two-week internship at
Abbott Singapore to explore how STEM is applied in a real-world context.
He was exposed to various job prospects within Abbott, such as Clinical
Research, Nutrition Science, Project Management, Consumer Science, and
Sensory Science. Carlo eventually chose to focus on Innovation Development,
where he learnt how different AI tools and research papers are used in
the medical field.</p>
<p><em>“I am grateful for this opportunity as I gained valuable insights into different job prospects within the STEM field. The exposure to real-world innovation and challenges has enhanced my problem-solving skills and sharpened my critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking. I was also privileged to work with professionals from the science field and collaborate with other students, which greatly improved my teamwork and communication skills. I would strongly recommend other students to take up such an experience!” - </em>Lingat
Juan Carlo, 4 Respect</p>
