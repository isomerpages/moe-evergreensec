Our school runs a House System to bring the school population together beyond the confines of class identity. It is a platform for greater social mixing across the different classes, levels and academic streams, helping students to bond and forge stronger friendships.

Our houses were named after six founding fathers. They are Mr David Marshall, Mr Eddie Barker, Mr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Lim Kim San, Mr Othman Wok and Mr S. Rajaratnam. The rationale for the selection is based on the character traits of these pioneers and a reflection of Singapore’s multi-racialism. By wearing the names of these founding fathers, we hope that EVGians will be inspired to live out the founding fathers’ values, which are mirrored in our school values of Respect, Integrity, Commitment and Enterprise.
