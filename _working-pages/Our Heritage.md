Established in 2000, Evergreen Secondary School received its first batch of 320 students and 12 teaching staff. In June 2000, Evergreen Secondary School moved into its present premises at 11 Woodlands Street 83. 

To imbue in its students an indomitable spirit and strength in character, the school has actively cultivated in its students an intimate knowledge of the character traits of the founding leaders of modern Singapore. In recognition of the quality of its National Education (NE) programme, Evergreen Secondary School was designated the North Zone Centre of Excellence in NE in 2003. The school also received the Lee Kuan Yew NE Award (2004 and 2008) and was conferred the Niche Programme Status for NE in 2009. In 2014, the school was affirmed with the Best Practice in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).  

The school continues to pursue its mission of nurturing students with the passion to contribute and excel over the years. In 2014, teachers adopted the approach of being character coaches to students, guiding them to hone their character and strengths as they go through various schooling experiences. In doing so, teachers would seize teaching moments in various contexts, and facilitate deep learning and self-reflection for every student.

To ensure its students are future-ready, in 2015, the school launched its _Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Effective Communication in English_. In 2020, under the _Enhanced ALP_ initiative by MOE, the programme was expanded to include Mother Tongue subjects. It is now one of the four secondary schools in Singapore to offer the programme. It prepares students for the future by leveraging real-world contexts to develop the ability to communicate in verbal and written forms, in both conventional and digital platforms. The school‘s _Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in is Sports Education_. Since 2016, the LLP has nurtured its students to take personal responsibility in maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle. In 2021 the school rolled out the _Personal Learning Device (PLD)_ initiative to further cultivate 21st century competencies in students as future-ready citizens and leaders.

Year 2020 marked the school’s 20th anniversary. With Covid-19, its staff and students exhibited remarkable resilience and innovation to ensure learning continues on be it digitally during the Circuit Breaker or physically with the Safe Management Measures.

The school continues to grow from strength to strength, and in 2021 celebrated its 21st anniversary in _Coming of Age_ as a choice school in the Woodlands region
