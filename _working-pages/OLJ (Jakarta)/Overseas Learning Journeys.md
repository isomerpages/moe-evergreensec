Every year, Secondary 3 EVGians will get the opportunity to go for Overseas Learning Journeys (OLJs). Through these learning journeys, they are able to immerse themselves into the culture and language of the countries they are visiting, while also learning about independence, resilience and teamwork. 

In previous years, some of these OLJs  have taken our students to cities in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and China for Cultural Immersion and Leadership Training. Watch a video below on one of our trips to China!

COVID did put a hamper on our OLJ plans, but we are back in full swing in 2023!
Watch this space in July as we show highlights of 2023 OLJs to Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Jakarta!
