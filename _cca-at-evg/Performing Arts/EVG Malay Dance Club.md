**Learning Journey to Bukit Chandu**  
Held during the March holidays, the learning journey to Bukit Changdu aimed to give the dancers an appreciation of the sacrifices of our past generations to the nation. It gave the dancers an opportunity to understand the values held by the soldiers in overcoming challenges and obstacles. Visiting Bukit Chandu also provided them an opportunity to feel the “Kampung atmosphere” which allowed them to get into their respective characters when they danced.
