**Vision:**   
An EVG Community with a Passion for Health

**Mission:**  
To equip our students with the skills, knowledge and attitudes to pursue a physically active and healthy lifestyle

**Purpose of PE:**  
The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

**Goals of PE:**  
A comprehensive, well-articulated syllabus helps students to achieve the goals of physical education. The six goals are equally important - each interacts with others in a well-planned programme that addresses the knowledge, skills and values desired for every student.

Physical education seeks to develop in each student the ability to:  
Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.  
Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.  
Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.  
Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences.  
Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.  
Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

**Key Programmes for mass participation**  
Our key outdoor programmes include the Sec 1 Camp Confidence, Sec 2 Camp Dynamism and Sec 3 Camp Resilience which are held every year. These camps are aimed at promoting self/peer leadership, self-confidence and peer interaction. They also create opportunities for students to develop SE competencies of Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management and Responsible Decision making through various team-building activities.

An annual event since 2007, the EVG Road Run provides an excellent opportunity for staff, parents and students to interact while engaging in exercise. The Road Run also incorporated a ‘Fun Run/Walk’ element so as to encourage students who were overweight, students with asthma and other medical conditions to participate.

The EVG Sports Carnival is a key initiative which offers sports competitions to all EVGians to encourage mass sports participation. These sports include Inter-House Badminton, Soccer and Dragon Boating. These competitions are meant to enrich the students’ experience in playing sports and to enable them to continue playing the sport as recreational activities beyond school.

**Character & Leadership Development through Sports**  
Sport Singapore has developed the CLDS Framework that features the use of game activities and specific role playing for the learning and development of performance, social and moral values and attributes. Evergreen Secondary School is one of the pilot schools to adopt this framework into PE lesson planning. The CLDS Framework works on the basis that ethical lessons and values-in-sport must be specifically “taught” rather than just caught from the experience. Through CLDS, the explicit teaching of values and student leadership development is infused into the PE pedagogies.
