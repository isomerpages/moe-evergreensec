In Evergreen Secondary School, we believe in developing leadership in all students through our customized student leadership development programme. Student leadership is an integral part of the school’s overall Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme. Our leadership approach is aligned with our schoolwide CCE framework in terms of our emphasis on inculcating school values in students. The model which we have adopted that we feel best aligns with our desired outcomes is the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership – known worldwide as the most practical model of leadership development. We aim to develop leadership competencies in all students through a structured programme we have termed ‘Leadership-in-Action (L.I.A.)’.

**Leadership In Action approach:**

Leadership education in EVG is driven by the LIA approach. In EVG, we believe that Leadership is action, not position. We hope for our student leaders to lead out of a desire to serve others with strong personal convictions about their leadership roles in the school. The L.I.A. programme is supported by “7 Pillars of L.I.A.” and implemented through a cohort-wide development programme and role specific development programme. These 7 pillars are:

**Cohort-wide Development Programme**

The pinnacle of the Cohort-wide Development Programme is the Service Learning Programme, during which all Secondary Three students will plan, organize and implement self-initiated projects to serve the community. The Service Learning Programme is one of our key school programmes and it develops our students to be self-directed learners, active contributors, concerned citizens and confident people.

**Role-specific Development**

With the Role-specific Development Programme, students will take on distinct student leadership responsibilities and perform their roles in various areas.
