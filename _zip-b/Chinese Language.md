#### **Chinese Unit Programmes & Events**


##### **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

Sec 3 ALP: Lyrics Writing

Evergreen Secondary School has been selected as one of the four schools in Singapore to offer the Enhanced ALP (Mother Tongue Languages), and this is the prototype year for us to plan, craft, test out and refine the curriculum for the Enhanced ALP.

EVG’s Enhanced ALP programme offers a comprehensive curriculum to guide students in their lyrical expressions and to convey their emotions through music. The songs that have been produced through this programme have been sent in to represent the school for the annual Xinyao competition, and have received many accolades. The writing of Xinyao gives students a valuable opportunity to express themselves in an original and creative way, and they also learn how to apply Mandarin in an authentic context.

##### **2021 Chinese New Year Celebration**


Chinese New Year Celebration 2021 – Year of the Ox

Chinese New Year is one of the most important festivals for Chinese. In 2021, we are ushering the New Year and adapting to a new normal due to the worldwide COVID-19 situation. It might seem daunting for all but we should learn from the Ox, to have the important quality of resilience in order to rise up against the odds.&nbsp; As a school, we celebrated and ushered in the Ox Year with an online concert! We have the Chinese Dance and Chinese Orchestra to perform for us. Not only that, we also have Zaki and Hazirah from 2 Integrity who have prepared a Silat performance! On top of that, Ryan Ng from 4 Etp also performed a solo martial art who also represents the school and has done phenomenally well in the National School Games Wushu Championships for the past few years.

Do enjoy the recorded telecast of the CNY celebration comprising a myriad of performances put up by our very own EVGians via the Youtube link below!

##### **Reading Programme**


Chinese Unit launched the Graded Learning Programme with the Secondary Ones this year.&nbsp; Through this programme, we hope to cultivate the habit of reading in our students, enable them to find enjoyment and widen their perspective through reading.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our teachers developed learning packages that will promote critical discussion in class thereby enriching students’ reading experiences.&nbsp; Thereafter, students will design and present their book reviews to their peers.&nbsp; Not only does this serve to clarify their views on the books they read, it also helps them to communicate ideas and allow creative expression, transforming what they have read to pictorial forms.

Some of the students’ book reviews are as below:
