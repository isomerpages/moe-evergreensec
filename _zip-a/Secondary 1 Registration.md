##### **Subject-Based Banding**

**(d)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I appeal for my child to take subjects at a more demanding level?**

There is no appeal as the offer is first made based on the PSLE Achievement Level. However, if a student did well for the subject and met the eligible criteria (with reference to the Weighted Assessment and Semestral Assessment results respectively) at the end of Secondary 1 Semester 1 or 2, he / she may be given the offer to take up the subject(s) at higher level

##### **Higher Mother Tongue Language**

**(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I appeal for my child to take Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL)?**

Eligibility for HMTL is based on MOE’s letter of offer for the Secondary 1 students. Subsequently, our school may offer other students to take up HMTL based on his/her interest, aptitude and overall school-based performance.

**(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the merits of taking HMTL?**

HMTL offers students the opportunities to learn Chinese or Malay at a more advanced level. It will develop students with the ability, aptitude and interest in MTL to achieve higher levels of language proficiency and cultural knowledge.

##### **Tamil Lessons**

**(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child would like to take Tamil lessons. What are the arrangements for his/ her Tamil lessons?**

Evergreen Secondary School does not offer Tamil Language as a subject. The dedicated Tamil Language Centre for EVG is Marsiling Secondary School. Secondary One students who are taking Tamil Language at G3 (Express) can enroll at Marsiling Secondary School. Tamil Language students taking Tamil at G2 (NA) and G1 (NT) can enroll at Sembawang Secondary School. Students taking Tamil language will be allowed to leave earlier and proceed to the Tamil Centre on the days of their lessons. Currently, Tamil lessons are held once a week during the school term.

##### **Third Language**

**(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child would like to take a Third Language. Is it possible?**

Third Language offers are given by MOE based on the students’ PSLE results. Any appeal can be made directly to the MOE Language Centres.

##### **Support for the Child**
