**Sec 1 Registration**

**(c)**        **What is the duration of the Zoom Session on 23 December 2021?**

The duration of the Zoom session is around 1 hour. If you do have any concerns attending the Zoom session, you can contact the General Office.

**Subject-Based Banding**

**(d)       Can I appeal for my child to take subjects at a more demanding level?**

There is no appeal as the offer is first made based on the PSLE Achievement Level. However, if a student does well for the subject and meets the eligible criteria (with reference to the Weighted Assessment and Semestral Assessment results respectively) at the end of Secondary 1 Semester 1 or 2, he/ she may be given the offer to take up the subject(s) at a higher level.

**Higher Mother Tongue Language**

**(e)        Can I appeal for my child to take Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL)?**

Eligibility for HMTL is based on MOE’s letter of offer for the Secondary 1 students. Subsequently, our school may offer other students to take up HMTL based on his/her interest, aptitude and overall school-based performance.

**(f)       What are the merits of taking HMTL?**

HMTL offers students the opportunities to learn Chinese or Malay at a more advanced level. It will develop students with the ability, aptitude and interest in MTL to achieve higher levels of language proficiency and cultural knowledge.

**Tamil Lessons**

**(g)       My child would like to take Tamil lessons. What are the arrangements for his/ her Tamil lessons?**

Evergreen Secondary School does not offer Tamil Language as a subject. The dedicated Tamil Language Centre for EVG is Marsiling Secondary School. Students taking Tamil Language will be allowed to leave earlier and proceed to the Tamil Centre on the days of their lessons. Currently, Tamil lessons are held once a week during school term.

**Third Language**

**(h)         My child would like to take a Third Language. Is it possible?**

Third Language offers are given by MOE based on the students’ PSLE results. Any appeal can be made directly to the MOE Language Centres.

**Support for the child**

**(i)         My child has been having counselling in Primary School and would like to continue with counselling. How can I discuss the arrangement with the school?**

Parents may contact the Form Teachers to request for counselling support, providing current areas of concerns, and the school counsellor will schedule a counselling session with the child.

**(j)        My child has special needs. How do I inform the school about it?**

Parents may contact Ms Khaleeda (our Allied Educator for Learning and Behavioural Support, AED/LBS), and speak to her to address your concerns. You can contact Ms Khaleeda through the Form Teachers. If you have given consent for your child’s Primary School to pass on the diagnosis and intervention details of your child, our school will receive the information in January.

**Parents Support Group (PSG)**

**(k)         How do I join the PSG?**

You can register using the online form: [https://go.gov.sg/evgjoinpsg](https://form.gov.sg/619efe0628360800138e77e5)

**(l)      How often does the PSG meet up?**

The PSG meetings are held on a termly basis.

**(m)       How does joining the PSG enable parents to better support their children in secondary school?**

You can attend PSG meetings where school staff will share more about department programmes for parents to better understand the school and where support is given to students. The support network of parents may also share parenting tips and support each other on the parenting journey. There will also be invitations to workshops on parenting and support for students, and invitations to participate in school activities with students and teachers in school or online.
