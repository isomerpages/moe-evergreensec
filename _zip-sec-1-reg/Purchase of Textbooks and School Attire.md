Due to the escalating Covid-19 situation resulting in major shipment delays, there will not be sufficient school **shirts** and **skirts** for sale. We seek your understanding that there will be a limit of **1 piece of shirt** and **1 piece of skirt** per student. This is to allow as many students as possible to be in uniform when school reopens.  In the event that you are unable to get a full set of uniform, please be assured that your child can report to school in their primary school uniforms for the first 2 weeks.

**2.1 For N(A) and N(T) Course Students Eligible for Higher Demand Subjects through Subject-based Banding (SBB)**

*   Students are to report to the School Hall on **23 December 2021** at their allocated timeslot to collect their SBB option form.

| Surname starting with | Time Slot on 23 December |
|:---------------------:|:------------------------:|
|         A to I        |     10.30 to 11.30 am    |
|         J to Q        |   11.30 am to 12.30 pm   |
|         R to Z        |     12.30 to 1.30 pm     |

The student must submit the SBB option form after he/she has made the choices for eligible subjects at the more demanding level (e.g. he/she is admitted to the N(A) course, but eligible for, and intend to offer Science and Mathematics at Express level).

*   Based on the student’s subject choices, he/she will be given the relevant booklist.
*   After submission of the SBB option form, parents and students may proceed to purchase:
    *   Textbooks and stationery, and
    *   School uniforms and PE shorts (excluding **PE T-shirt\***)

**PE T-shirt****\* :** The colour of the PE T-shirt will depend on the class/house that students are assigned. As the class/house allocation will only be assigned by **27 December 2021** (after SBB option collation), time will be given for Secondary 1 students to purchase the PE T-shirt in school (at the EP corner) on the first day of school.
