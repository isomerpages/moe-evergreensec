**Mission**  
We nurture students with a curiosity and humility to learn about the world around them through scientific approaches, leading to sound scientific understanding that empowers them to contribute and excel as active citizens.

**Vision**  
A dynamic team to ignite the passion for learning of Science.

**Copernicus Research-based Integrated Science Programme**

Students enjoy an engaging and rigorous Science curriculum at Evergreen Secondary School. While Biology, Chemistry and Physics are taught as distinct disciplines by different teachers, a range of activities, events and workshops are organised every year to integrate the three subjects. After all, Science is not only a branch of knowledge but a way of thinking that aims to solve the problems in our world today.

The Copernicus Research-based Integrated Science Programme (CRISP) aims to instil in every student a spirit of curiosity and an eagerness to explore and investigate both the natural and social sciences. Such an attitude was embodied by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Renaissance-era polymath who was well-versed in Mathematics, Astronomy, Medicine, Politics and Economics.

**Secondary 2: Project Work, Competitions and Enrichment** **Programmes**

**(****1) Interdisciplinary Project Work**

As part of the curriculum, students apply the scientific method to plan and carry out investigations to explain interesting phenomena. Alternatively, they embark on the iterative design cycle to engineer solutions to problems faced by people in their daily lives. At the end of the year, they present their findings and products to their classmates. They may even have an opportunity to implement their ideas within the school setting.

**(2) North Zone** **Elementz** **Competition**

Students with an interest and aptitude for scientific research are given the opportunity to showcase their promising projects at the annual North Zone Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition under the guidance of teacher mentors. As students collect and analyse data, complete research papers and answer questions posed by a panel of judges, they get a glimpse into the rigour of scientific research.

**(3)** **Electives**

\- **Crime** **Science** **Investigation**

Every year, our teachers conduct an in-house module on forensic science techniques. Students learn how to examine and process evidence, including how to analyse blood samples, glass shattering patterns, fingerprints and other types of available evidence, in order to eliminate suspects and eventually identify the culprit. Through role-play, students learn to record observations, take measurements, form hypotheses and make deductions by interpreting a variety of data.

\- **Dental Science**

In 2018, Professor Jaya and a team of PhD candidates from the National University of Singapore Faculty of Dentistry conducted a module to teach students how to perform common investigative dental procedures using a range of laboratory apparatus. In the process of learning how to achieve good dental health, they even learnt how to extract material from the mouth from current practitioners.

**Secondary 3: Research Programmes, Exhibitions**

**(1) RP Scientific Inquiry Research**

**(2) VJC A\* Science Fair**

**(3) NUS Crystal Growing Challenge**

The event is organised by the National University of Singapore every 2 years.

**Green Environment Education**  
This programme has been in place since 2009 with the following objectives:

*   Promote the conservation of the environment and climate awareness to the school population.
*   To raise awareness of the importance of being a global citizen.
*   To encourage students to share and promote the importance of the conservation of the environment and climate awareness to their family and friends at home.

Every year, we carry out the following activities at different times of the year to promote and increase the staff and students’ environmental awareness on the recent environmental issues at hand. The list of programmes and activities that they may be involved in are as follows:

1.  Learning Journey to NEWater Visitor Centre
2.  National Environment Quiz
3.  Earth Hour and Earth Day Activities and Lesson (whole school)
4.  Interdisciplinary Project Work (Lower Secondary students)
5.  Values in action (VIA) project

**School Green Award**  
The SEC-StarHub School Green Awards (SGA) is a self-audited voluntary environmental programme which serves as a platform for students to develop and showcase their environmental efforts, through customised activities which will help them gain a better understanding of the environment. Evergreen Secondary School has once again achieved the Lotus Sustained Achievement Award in the SEC-StarHub School Green Awards (SGA) 2017. We have been attaining the Lotus Sustained Achievement Award since 2012.

**National Environment Quiz**  
Every year, three of our Lower Secondary students take part in the National Environment Quiz organised by Nan Hua High School. The quiz aims to increase awareness of environmental issues amongst students.

**Earth Hour**  
On the week of Earth Hour, students were also encouraged to switch off their lights for one hour to support energy conservation.

Students making announcement about Earth Hour

**Earth Day**  
Lessons on reducing the carbon footprint were planned during Home Period and the importance of reducing the use of plastics was also emphasised. On one of the days, an exhibition was held at the Notice Board Area to raise awareness of the ways the students can help to conserve the environment. There were also games for students to try out during their recesses.
