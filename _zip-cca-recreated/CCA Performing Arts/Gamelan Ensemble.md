vergreen Secondary School introduced Gamelan Ensemble in 2004. It is called Evergreen Secondary School Sri Cemara Gamelan Ensemble.

**What is Gamelan?**  
Gamelan is derived from the word ‘Gamel’ which means to hit/ strike. Thus, Gamelan music is about percussion music; most instruments are played with the use of the mallets which look like wooden hammers.

Unlike many musical traditions, however, Gamelan strictly focuses on group music; you will never find a solo performance or part in any gamelan composition! This is because Gamelan Music is both simultaneous and polyphonic in nature. Simply put, it builds its music in layers. Every musician needs to depend on one another in order to have a successful performance, hence teamwork is greatly emphasized. Our Gamelan Ensemble prides itself on an almost telepathic relationship between its members!

Gamelan, in general, builds its music around the lives of people. It is a way of life for people in Indonesia, likened to that of the electric guitar and drums in the urban context. There are pieces that welcome people, pieces that portray tension, pieces that are meant for intermission  - one could even go so far as to say there are pieces for almost every situation! This reminds students of the many colours of life. While some may be dull, others are as bright as they can be. We must embrace life as true Singaporeans: to know that behind every dull colour lies the hope of bright colours!
