**EVG Badminton**  
EVG Badminton aims to develop student leaders to be resilient and committed athletes. The members hone their badminton skills and court craft through rigorous training routines that push students to develop their potential. Every student is given an opportunity to participate in a variety of team and individual events where they gain exposure and match experience through friendly matches, school competitions and external competitions. Together with their coach, EVG Badminton aims to build sportsmanship and strength in our students, inspiring them to be well-rounded athletes who are accomplished in both their sport and studies.
