The mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.

**Our Beliefs**  
In accordance with our mission and observing our objectives, we believe in:

*   _Developing Leaders with Character & Values_   
    Ensure our growth by exposing us to a challenging environment, which, in turn will imbibe us with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values.
*   _Building Bonds with SPF_   
    Enlighten us on the role of the Singapore Police Force, help to build a stronger bond of friendship with them, and so lead to a safer place for all in the country.
*   _Showing Care & Concern to Others_   
    As part of a culture that encourages us to treat fellow cadets with respect, courtesy and tact, teach us to extend the same care and concern to others.
*   _Facing Challenges & Achieving Excellence_ 
*   As a result of our identification with the Singapore Police Force, teach us to adopt its tradition of high standards of performance, commitment, duty and service, to seek to excel and to face up to challenges.
