Vision  
School & Parents in Partnership for the Healthy Development of our Children.

Mission  
To complement school's efforts to develop EVGians holistically through the active contribution of parents' time, skills, knowledge and network.

Model of Approach  
School Leads, Parents Support.

Impact on Child  
Parents' active involvement in the PSG sends an important message to the child that his/her parents and school are collaborating closely (Win-Win Relationship) in his/her holistic development to his/her best interests.

Roles / Activities  
Members of the PSG play an active parental support role and are involved in school programmes and events. PSG members also form a close group to attend meetings and workshops, enabling the sharing of parenting experiences with other parents. Each term, PSG members attend termly meetings where Heads of Departments share their departmental approach and programmes, and school leaders provide school updates. PSG members also attend parenting workshops organised by the school, to gain insights into the development of an adolescent and to be equipped with parenting skills to better bond with their child.
