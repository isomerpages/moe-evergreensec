Effective Communicators With a Heart

The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) –  Effective  Communicators with a  Heart – is a three-year  programme  which  leverages  on  real-world  contexts  to develop values, communication skills, and creative and critical thinking. It seeks to groom confident leaders with effective communication skills, the ability to express themselves clearly and creatively, and a strong sense of purpose to harness these skills to serve for the greater good.

In the present run, the English ALP is closely aligned with the English Language curriculum. The Secondary 1 Readers’ Theatre Programme focuses on the foundational skillsets of clarity and emotion in communication. The Secondary 2 Forum Theatre programme aims to develop students’ capacity for empathy as well as analytical and critical thinking, through the interactivity offered by Forum Theatre. Secondary 3 students undergo an intensive focus on effective presentation skills, honing their communication skills in order to speak persuasively, and with purpose. Authentic platforms to apply their skills are deliberately created in the students’ Service Learning Projects.

Evergreen Secondary School is also one of four schools in the whole of Singapore offering the Enhanced ALP in Mother Tongue Languages. Over a three-year curriculum, Chinese and Malay Language students are exposed to a range of experiences and cultural exposure programmes to help them develop a deeper appreciation of their Mother Tongue.

Students with strengths in communication skills are then given developmental avenues through participating in public speaking activities and hosting school-based activities, as well as participating in prestigious competitions such as national debate competitions, storytelling competitions and the Model United Nations. They also work closely with the school’s kNOW programme to present general knowledge and current affairs issues to the school population.

Another area of ALP that is unique to the school is our Music programme, which aims to develop and recognise students’ musical talents. Students go through a rich Lower Secondary Music curriculum which develops their musicality and songwriting skills, and those who show a keen interest are then grown through talent development programmes and representation at various music events and competitions both in and outside school.

Together, the EVG ALP gives every student, regardless of his or her academic course, a strong foundation and a competitive edge in expressing themselves effectively beyond the walls of the classroom.
