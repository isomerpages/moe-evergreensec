**Vision**  
Passion to Succeed.

**Mission**  
To develop winners with character.

**Purpose Of CCA**

1.  The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood.

2.  Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS) develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in pupils. The Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) instil in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society. Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students are honed in information, communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialised areas.

3.  Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.

4.  All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.

5.  Schools enable all students to have active and meaningful CCA participation when they provide a balanced, inclusive and diverse CCA programme which caters to a broad spectrum of interests and talents.

**CCA in Evergreen**  
Co-Curricular Activities in Evergreen Secondary School is COMPULSORY.

Every student must take part in one school-based CCA, which can be from the Physical Sports, Uniformed Group, Visual & Performing Arts or Clubs & Societies. Participation in a second CCA may be allowed, subject to regular attendance in first CCA, good academic performance and not more than 3 days of CCA in a week. Students who are keen to experience the different CCA in school may opt for a change at the beginning of each academic year.

**LEAPS 2.0**  
LEAPS 2.0 is a framework to recognise secondary school students’ holistic development. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in four domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.

**Participation**  
This domain recognises students’ participation in one school-based [\[2\]](https://evergreensec.moe.edu.sg/departments/co-curricular-activities/#_ftn2) Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). Recognition is based on the number of years of participation and exemplary conduct and active contribution [\[3\]](https://evergreensec.moe.edu.sg/departments/co-curricular-activities/#_ftn3) to the CCA. Sustained engagement in the same CCA allows for progressive development of character, skills, knowledge and friendships, and will be accorded higher recognition.

**Service**  
This domain recognises students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community. Every secondary school student will contribute at least 6 hours per school year to the community. They can choose to embark on a Values-In-Action project (VIA). Students will be recognised for the time they put into planning, service and reflection, when participating in a VIA project.

**Leadership**  
This domain recognises students’ leadership development. Recognition is accorded to students’ ability to take charge of personal development, work in a team and assume responsibilities in service of others. In addition to formal leadership appointments, participation in student leadership modules/workshops, the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) and leadership positions in the school, CCA or student-initiated/student-led projects will also be recognised.

**Achievement**  
This domain recognises students’ **representation** and **accomplishment** in co-curricular involvements beyond the classroom. Opportunities for representation and accomplishment present valuable learning experiences for students to learn discipline, resilience and develop their character. Students may represent the school or organisations endorsed by the school. Recognising external opportunities better caters to students’ diverse interests and talents. It also recognises the community’s role in developing the child.

**Representation** refers to being selected and endorsed by the school or an organisation endorsed by the school (e.g. the community club or national association) to contribute, perform or compete. It need not be tied to his/her CCA in school.

**Accomplishment** refers to attaining accolades and awards at competitions, festivals, performances, exhibitions, conferences and symposiums where the student represents the school or other organisations endorsed by the school.

**Recognition of Students’ Level of Attainment**  
At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment will be recognised according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment will be converted to a **bonus point(s)** which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Education (JC/Poly/ITE).

Please note that these bonus points are used to determine the net aggregate scores of students during posting to post-secondary institutions. They are not taken into consideration in determining whether applicants are eligible for specific courses in post-secondary institutions.

[\[1\]](https://evergreensec.moe.edu.sg/departments/co-curricular-activities/#_ftnref1) LEAPS stands for Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service. LEAPS 2.0 builds on the LEAPS system to better reflect MOE’s current emphasis on Student-Centric, Values-Driven education.  
[\[2\]](https://evergreensec.moe.edu.sg/departments/co-curricular-activities/#_ftnref2) School-based CCA refers to CCA that are organised within the school or have been endorsed by the school.  
[\[3\]](https://evergreensec.moe.edu.sg/departments/co-curricular-activities/#_ftnref3) Schools have processes in place to determine ‘exemplary conduct and active contribution’ with respect to their school’s context.
