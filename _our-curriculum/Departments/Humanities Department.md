**Vision**  
A dynamic team with a passion for engaging in life-long learning and excelling in a globalised world.

**Mission**  
We nurture Character as well as Confident and Critical thinkers (C3) who are passionate towards learning and excelling through the Humanities lens.

**Our Programmes**  
The Evergreen Humanities Department offers students the following subjects – Social Studies at Lower Secondary (Normal Technical Syllabus) and Upper Secondary (Express and Normal Academic Syllabi), and the choices of Core Geography and Core Literature, and History, Geography and Literature Electives.

The Humanities Department has various programmes to engage the students so that they are able to comprehend and appreciate the workings of the world around them.

**Academic Programmes**  
The learning of Humanities places more emphasis on an inquiry-based approach. For History and Social Studies, students are required to research, analyse and interpret different types of sources to support their own hypothesis. On the other hand, Geography students are exposed to investigative and inquiry-based fieldwork, in which they are required to gather data and make evaluations based on the information they have collected.

Lower Secondary students are introduced to skills such as describing trends, essay writing skills and source interpretations. Lower Secondary students also have the opportunity to conduct authentic customised historical and geographical research beyond the classroom.

**Key learning approach**  
The department’s key learning approach in teaching Humanities consists of multiple layers of scaffolding to help students unpack concepts and questions. The department practices _making thinking visible_ in constructing quality answers and using different levels of scaffolding to meet the needs of students with different learning profiles. In addition, the department also uses _guiding questions_ and _graphic organisers_ to structure students’ thinking processes and link concepts across the topics. Providing f_eedback for learning_ and _peer critiques_ are common pedagogical strategies used across the department to help students identify and bridge their learning gaps. This year, the department has embarked on using _Differentiated Instructions_ to cater to the diverse needs of our learners.

In 2018, the Evergreen Secondary School History Unit was awarded the MOE Innergy Award (Bronze) for our innovative use of Cognitive Scaffold for Critical Reading and Analysis of History Sources.

**Opportunities**  
Students participate in the annual NUS Geography Challenge and Interschool History Challenge as part of their extended learning curriculum.
