**Vision**  
Making Mother Tongue a Living Language

**Mission**  
A department that nurtures EVGIANs to love their Mother Tongue, appreciate their culture and practice good values.

#### **Chinese Unit Programmes & Events**


##### **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

Sec 3 ALP: Lyrics Writing

Evergreen Secondary School has been selected as one of the four schools in Singapore to offer the Enhanced ALP (Mother Tongue Languages), and this is the prototype year for us to plan, craft, test out and refine the curriculum for the Enhanced ALP.

EVG’s Enhanced ALP programme offers a comprehensive curriculum to guide students in their lyrical expressions and to convey their emotions through music. The songs that have been produced through this programme have been sent in to represent the school for the annual Xinyao competition, and have received many accolades. The writing of Xinyao gives students a valuable opportunity to express themselves in an original and creative way, and they also learn how to apply Mandarin in an authentic context.

##### **2021 Chinese New Year Celebration**


Chinese New Year Celebration 2021 – Year of the Ox

Chinese New Year is one of the most important festivals for Chinese. In 2021, we are ushering the New Year and adapting to a new normal due to the worldwide COVID-19 situation. It might seem daunting for all but we should learn from the Ox, to have the important quality of resilience in order to rise up against the odds.  As a school, we celebrated and ushered in the Ox Year with an online concert! We have the Chinese Dance and Chinese Orchestra to perform for us. Not only that, we also have Zaki and Hazirah from 2 Integrity who have prepared a Silat performance! On top of that, Ryan Ng from 4 Etp also performed a solo martial art who also represents the school and has done phenomenally well in the National School Games Wushu Championships for the past few years.

Do enjoy the recorded telecast of the CNY celebration comprising a myriad of performances put up by our very own EVGians via the Youtube link below!

**Reading Programme**
=====================

Chinese Unit launched the Graded Learning Programme with the Secondary Ones this year.  Through this programme, we hope to cultivate the habit of reading in our students, enable them to find enjoyment and widen their perspective through reading.   Our teachers developed learning packages that will promote critical discussion in class thereby enriching students’ reading experiences.  Thereafter, students will design and present their book reviews to their peers.  Not only does this serve to clarify their views on the books they read, it also helps them to communicate ideas and allow creative expression, transforming what they have read to pictorial forms.

Some of the students’ book reviews are as below:

**Virtual Learning Journey to Beijing and Tianjin**
===================================================

The year, EVG has organized a virtual learning journey to Beijing and Tianjin in November 2021. Through Zoom and 360° cameras, students were able to explore attractions like The Great Wall of China, The Forbidden City and the Singapore-Sino project in Tianjin Eco-city from the comforts of their classroom.  With the help of a local guide, students were able to learn interesting historical facts associated with these heritage sites. Different from that of last year, students had the opportunity to attend a lecture via livestream on Singapore-China diplomatic relations by Fudan University.

Last but not least, the learning journey culminated in an interaction session with students from Nankai Rixin International School, the Middle School section of Nankai University in Tianjin.  Our students looked very much forward to this segment and the session was full of excitement and good cheer.
