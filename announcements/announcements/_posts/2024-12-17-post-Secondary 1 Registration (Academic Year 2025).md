<h4><strong>8. Frequently Asked Questions and Other Queries</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Sec 1 Registration</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if I do not have Parents Gateway?</strong>
</p>
<p>Information will be placed on the school website. If you do have any queries,
you may contact the General Office at 63656392.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What is the duration of the Zoom Session on 19 December 2024?</strong>
</p>
<p>The duration of the Zoom session is around 30 mins. If you do have any
concerns attending the Zoom session, you may contact the General Office
at 63656392.</p>
<p><strong><u>Subject-Based Banding</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I appeal for my child to take subjects at a more demanding level?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no appeal as the offer is first made based on the PSLE Achievement
Level. However, if a student does well for the subject and meets the eligibility
criteria (with reference to their Weighted Assessment or End-of-Year Examination
results respectively) at the end of Secondary 1 Semester 1 or 2, he / she
may be given the offer to take up the subject(s) at more demanding level.</p>
<p><strong><u>Higher Mother Tongue Language</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp; Can I appeal for my child to take Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Eligibility for HMTL is based on MOE's letter of offer to the Secondary
1 students. Subsequently, our school may offer other students to take up
HMTL based on his/her interest, aptitude and overall school-based performance.</p>
<p><strong>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;What are the merits of taking HMTL?</strong>
</p>
<p>HMTL offers students the opportunities to learn Chinese or Malay at a
more advanced level. It will develop students with the ability, aptitude
and interest in MTL to achieve higher levels of language proficiency and
cultural knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp; What should I do if my child declines the HMTL offer?</strong>
</p>
<p>If your child does not wish to take up the HMTL offer, please purchase
the regular G3 MTL textbook instead.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tamil Lessons</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child would like to take Tamil lessons. What are the arrangements for his / her Tamil lessons?</strong>
</p>
<p>Evergreen Secondary School does not offer Tamil Language as a subject.
The dedicated Tamil Language Centre for our students is Sembawang Secondary
School. We will enrol our students in Sembawang Secondary School Tamil
Classes based on their Tamil Language subject bands. Students taking Higher
Tamil Language will be enrolled in Marsiling Secondary School for Tamil
classes. Students taking Tamil language will be allowed to leave school
earlier to proceed to the Tamil Centre on the days of their lessons. Currently,
Tamil lessons are held once a week during the school term.</p>
<p><strong><u>Third Language</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp; My child would like to take a Third Language. Is it possible?</strong>
</p>
<p>Third Language offers are given by MOE based on the students' PSLE results.
Any appeal should be made directly to the MOE Language Centres.</p>
<p><strong><u>Support for the Child</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My child has been having counselling in Primary School and would like to continue with counselling. How can I discuss the arrangements with the school?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may contact the Form Teachers to request for counselling support,
providing current areas of concerns, and the school counsellor will meet
the child to assess their counselling needs.</p>
<p><strong>(j) </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>My child has special needs. How do I inform the school about it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may email Mrs Julia Raj (HOD / CCE &amp; Student Well-Being) at
<a href="mailto:julia_chia_jing_yi@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">julia_chia_jing_yi@schools.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(k) </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>My child has health issues. How do I inform the school about it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may email Mr James Ng (HOD / PE &amp; CCA) at <a href="mailto:james_ng_aik_gian@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">james_ng_aik_gian@schools.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Parents Support Group (PSG)</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I join the PSG?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You can register using the online form: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/joinevgpsg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/joinevgpsg</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(m) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often does the PSG meet up?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The PSG meetings are held on a termly basis.</p>
<p><strong>(n) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does joining the PSG enable parents to better support their children in secondary school?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can attend PSG meetings where staff will share more about programmes
for parents to better understand the school, and where parents can explore
ways to participate and contribute to school activities. Through such active
participation, parents gain not only a better understanding of secondary
life and hence how to better support their child, but also gain the support
and insights from fellow parents on the same journey. There will also be
invitations to workshops on parenting and how to provide support for students.</p>
