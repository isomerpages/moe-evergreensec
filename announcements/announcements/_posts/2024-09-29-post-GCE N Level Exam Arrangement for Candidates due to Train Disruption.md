<p>For students taking the GCE N-level Written Exam, please note that:</p>
<p>1. In view of the current train service disruption, please refer to the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SMRTCorpSG/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SMRT Facebook Page</a>or the LTA’s My Transport APP for latest train service
updates, and make alternative arrangement and plan for additional travelling
time to the examination centres if the train service is not resumed by
then.</p>
<p>2. Students will be allowed to sit for the examination and be given the
full duration as long as they reach their examination centre before the
end of the examination. Candidates should refer to SEAB’s website : <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/.../exami.../train-disruption-advice" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SEAB - Train Service Disruption Advice</a> for
details on what they should do if they encounter a train service disruption
on examination day(s).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
