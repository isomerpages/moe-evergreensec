<h4><strong>8. Frequently Asked Questions and Other Queries</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Sec 1 Registration</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens if I do not have Parents Gateway?</strong>
</p>
<p>Information will be placed on the school website. If you do have any queries,
you may contact the General Office at 63656392.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>What is the duration of the MS Teams Session on 22 December 2025?</strong>

concerns about attending the session, you may contact the General Office

<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Full Subject-Based Banding</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I appeal for my child to take subjects at a more demanding level?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no appeal as the offer is first made based on the PSLE Achievement
Level. However, if a student does well for the subject and meets the eligibility
criteria (with reference to their Weighted Assessments and/or End-of-Year
Examination results) at the end of Secondary 1 Semester 1 or 2, he / she
may be given an offer to take up the subject(s) at more demanding level.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Higher Mother Tongue Languages</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I appeal for my child to take Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Eligibility for HMTL is based on MOE's letter of offer to the Secondary
1 students. Subsequently, our school may offer other students to take up
HMTL based on his/her interest, aptitude, teacher’s assessment and overall
school-based performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(e) </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>What are the merits of taking HTML?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HMTL offers students the opportunities to learn a language at a more advanced
level. It will develop students with the ability, aptitude and interest
in MTL towards achieving higher levels of language proficiency and cultural
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should I do if my child declines the HMTL offer?</strong>
</p>
<p>If your child does not wish to take up the HMTL offer, please purchase
the regular G3 MTL textbook instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Tamil Lessons</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child would like to take Tamil lessons. What are the arrangements for his / her Tamil lessons?</strong>
</p>
<p>Evergreen Secondary School does not offer Tamil Language as a subject.
The dedicated Tamil Language Centre for our students is Marsiling Secondary
School. We will enrol our students taking Higher Tamil Language or Tamil
Language at the various subject levels in Marsiling Secondary School. Students
taking Tamil language will be allowed to leave school earlier to proceed
to the Tamil Centre on the days of their lessons. Currently, Tamil lessons
are held once a week during the school term.</p>
<p><strong><u>Third Language</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child would like to take a Third Language. Is it possible?</strong>
</p>
<p>Third Language offers are given by MOE based on the students' PSLE results.
Any appeal should be made directly to the MOE Language Centres.</p>
<p><strong><u>Support for your Child</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child has been having counselling in Primary School and would like to continue with counselling. How can I discuss the arrangements with the school?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may contact the Form Teachers to request for counselling support,
providing current areas of concerns, and the school counsellor will meet
the child to assess their counselling needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(j) </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>My child has special needs. How do I inform the school about it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may email Ms Joanna Lee (AYH/Student Well-Being) at <a href="lee_teck_miang@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lee_teck_miang@schools.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(k) </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>My child has health issues. How do I inform the school about it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may email Mr James Ng (HOD/PE&amp;CCA) at <a href="james_ng_aik_gian@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">james_ng_aik_gian@schools.gov.sg</a> or
Ms Lydia Sng (SH/CCA&amp;LLP) at <a href="lydia_sng_pei_en@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lydia_sng_pei_en@schools.gov.sg</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Parents Support Group (PSG)</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I join the PSG?</strong>
</p>
<p>You may register using the online form: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/joinevgpsg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/joinevgpsg</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(m) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often does the PSG meet up?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The PSG meetings are held on a termly basis, as
well as when needed to support or participate in school events</p>
<p><strong>(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does joining the PSG enable parents to better support their children in secondary school?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can attend PSG meetings where staff will share more about school programmes
to help parents better understand the school, and where parents can explore
ways to participate in and contribute to school activities. Through such
active participation, parents not only gain a better understanding of secondary
school life and how to support their child, but also receive support and
insights from fellow parents on the same journey. There will also be invitations
to workshops on parenting and providing support for students.</p>
