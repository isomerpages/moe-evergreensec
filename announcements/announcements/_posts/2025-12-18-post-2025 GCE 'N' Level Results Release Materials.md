<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for your support and presence during the release of the 2025
GCE N-Level results.</p>
<p>As shared during the hall briefing, we would like to reiterate that <strong>there are multiple pathways for our students to continue their learning journey</strong>,
and that this phase is about making <strong>informed and thoughtful choices</strong>,
rather than rushing into decisions.</p>
<p>For your reference, we have attached the <strong>edited set of slides that was presented to students and parents in the hall</strong>.
These slides are intended to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Recap the <strong>post-secondary pathways and progression options</strong> discussed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarify key concepts such as <strong>eligibility versus course posting</strong> (e.g.
PFP, DPP, ITE and Polytechnic routes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support <strong>constructive conversations at home</strong> between parents/guardians
and your teen</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage families to review the slides together at your own pace,
using them as a guide to discuss interests, strengths and possible next
steps.</p>
<p><strong>Further Guidance &amp; Support</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ECG Counselling Support</strong>
<br>Students who require further guidance may approach the school ECG Counsellor
or make an appointment with the ECG Centre @ MOE at

<li>
<p><strong>School Support</strong>
<br>Our Year Head team and Form Teachers remain available should students
require clarification or reassurance during this transition period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for partnering the school in supporting our students during
this important milestone. With time, guidance and encouragement, our teens
will find pathways that allow them to continue growing with confidence
and purpose.</p>
