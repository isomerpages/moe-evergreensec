<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has partnered the Ministry of Culture,
Community &amp; Youth (MCCY) to set up SP-CCA Athletics, SP-CCA Canoeing
(new) and SP-CCA Water Polo. This programme is open to secondary school
students from schools that do not offer these physical sports CCAs. Secondary
school students enrolled in SP-CCA can participate in this programme in
lieu of their school-based CCA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To find out more about SP-CCA, you and your child are invited to attend
the online engagement session. During the engagement session, MOE officers,
together with ActiveSG coaches, will share the programme objectives and
training requirements (venues, number of sessions per week, timing of each
session). Your child will also have the opportunity to attend tryout sessions
in January 2025 before confirming his/her participation in the programme.
More details on the tryout sessions will be shared during the engagement
session.&nbsp;</p>
