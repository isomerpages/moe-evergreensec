4.  School candidates who are unwell or self-isolating due to a positive COVID-19 test result should not return to school to collect their results. They should access their results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal at www.seab.gov.sg from 2.45pm on Thursday, 12 January 2023 to 11.59pm on Thursday, 26 January 2023.

5.  Students who are unable to collect their results in person can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results. Students may contact their school for assistance with the appointment of a proxy, or if they have not received their system-generated username for SEAB’s Candidates Portal.
