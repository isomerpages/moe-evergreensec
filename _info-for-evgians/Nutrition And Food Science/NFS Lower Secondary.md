Our goals are:

1.  to empower students to be health-conscious and discerning consumers
2.  to enable the students and their families to manage their resources _(food, finance and time)_ to meet their physical, mental, social and economic needs

**Sec 2 EVG HEALTHY WEEK**  
Our first EVG Healthy Week was organised in April to promote healthy eating habits for all students and teachers. We started the week by distributing an apple to all students and teachers during morning assembly.

All Secondary 2 students created posters and games on different topics assigned to them such as ‘Eat Whole Grains’ or ‘Choose Healthy Oils’. Everyday, different groups from each class presented their posters and games during recess time. Students from all levels as well as teachers were all eager to try the very interesting games. Healthy, yummy and attractive prizes were given out to all students who participated at the booths.

A K-Pop Mass Workout was also organised in collaboration with the Health Promotion Board as part of the school’s Assembly Programme to encourage students to exercise while having fun. Our teachers were game enough to join in the fun too.
