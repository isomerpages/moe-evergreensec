Our lower secondary programme is implemented in two semesters in a year. The first semester is for the Secondary One and the second semester is for the Secondary Two students. Our D&T projects are tightly linked with our school’s niche area, National Education. National Education is part of a holistic education that aims to develop national cohesion and emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. Students need to do research and include elements of Singapore’s identity into the designs of their projects. Through this Lower Secondary programme, students will have opportunities to show their creativity in their designs, learn technology topics and go through the whole design process.
