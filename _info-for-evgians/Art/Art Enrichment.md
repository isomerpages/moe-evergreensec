**Interactive Art Booths**  
Driven by the belief that everyone can be engaged through Art, the Secondary Three Express Art Students took art making out of the classrooms by engaging their lower secondary juniors in a variety of craft booths during recess. Through offering a fun session of crafts ranging from shrink plastic keychains, calligraphy, watercolour cartoon characters badge design to tiles and pots paintings, these young artists had an exhilarating experience of bringing people together through Art.

**SYF 2018 Art Exhibition**

The SYF Art Exhibition, in its 50th Year this year, provides opportunities for student artists from Singapore schools to showcase their artistic talents and to promote art appreciation in schools and the community. One of our students had her artwork selected to be displayed in the National Gallery Singapore. She gave an artist talk and also conducted a one-hour session of Fringe Activities for a group of art club students from Angsana Primary School. The participants were asked to ideate a mini quilt patch in response to the artist’s work and they will be putting up their finished art pieces in a form of a quilt composition back in their school.
