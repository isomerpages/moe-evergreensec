Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.

The goals of ECG are to:

*   nurture student’s self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning and training; (Skills)
*   enable students to explore viable education and career options through the provision of accurate and comprehensive information; (Knowledge)
*   inculcate an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the well-functioning of society; (Mindsets) and
