**VISION OF ELDDS**  
Confident and eloquent communicators that strive towards literary and cultural excellence.

**ELDDS**

The English Literary Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS) is one of the most colourful and dynamic co-curricular activities in the school. Armed with the vision to develop young students in becoming confident, poised and eloquent communicators that enjoy, appreciate and strive towards literary and cultural excellence, students undergo an extensive programme curated for three robust divisions; the Drama, Debate and E-journalism Divisions. Each of these divisions serves to allow students to nurture and exercise their creative, intellectual and oratorical capacities.

Our key annual inter-divisional event is the EVG Debate Invitationals (EVGDI), which sees invited schools from all over Singapore pitting their debating skills against each other. The objectives of EVGDI are:

To provide novice debaters with the opportunity to:

*   Represent their schools at the inter-school level.
*   Debate thought-provoking motions, thereby honing their debating skills.

To provide participating schools with a platform for interaction and friendly debate opportunities.

EVGDI 2019 saw an unprecedented number of 12 teams debating over 2 weekends, on 27 July and 3 August. At the Grand Finals, the Overall Champion was Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School. Evergreen Team B also achieved the First Runner-Up award, while the Best Speaker award at the Semi-Finals (Impromptu Round) went to John Poon.

### **Debate**

### Since its inception, the Debate Division has been active in fostering a dynamic debating culture in school. It aims to improve debaters’ general knowledge and sharpen their critical thinking skills. As such, opportunities for its members to represent the school in inter-school debating and oratorical competitions are numerous.

**2021 Achievements**

On 14 August, a team of Sec 1s and 2s participated at the Hua Yi Debate Invitational. It was their first open debate tournament. It was a daunting experience and the students pitted their skills against schools beyond our school cluster. The team has truly done us proud as they emerged as the Quarter-Finalists, among 40 other debate teams.

The young team of debaters are as follows:

1.  HUMARANG SABRINA GABRIELLE SORTIJAS (1 CHR)
2.  JOEY OH JO EE (1 ITG)
3.  GRACELYN ONG XIN LING (1THK)
4.  AUNI TAN BINTE ZAKI TAN ABDULLAH, the Debate Captain (2CMT)

During the unprecedented times in July, two debate teams took on the challenge to participate in the Debate Association Debate Championships (DADC) 2020 which was held online. As a result, all the trainings were a different ball game as face-to-face interactions took a back seat.

It was a true test of the debaters’ grit. However, they rose to the occasion and beat 7 other teams to emerge as Champions of the Silver division. Kudos to these two teams of fighters.

The Division 3 Debating Championships held in January 2020 was a test of the debaters’ grit and teamwork as they had to participate in three rounds of debate in a day. The debaters would testify that it was a truly enriching experience and a valuable opportunity for dynamic teamwork.

Bernard and Marsya achieved the Best Speaker Award at Rounds 2 and 3 respectively.

### Drama

The Drama Division aims to inculcate in our students a deep love for the dramatic arts through creative, witty, and impactful performances. We train our students to be comfortable in a variety of public speaking and public performance engagements. Drama members participate in a wide spectrum of school-based performances such as our Chinese New Year Celebrations and National Day Celebrations. Our members also participate in the prestigious Odyssey of the Mind (Singapore), an annual creative problem-solving competition at Anglo Chinese School (Independent) where our members go up against schools like School Of The Arts and Raffles Girls Secondary School. Through these activities, members learn and sharpen their dramatic skills as well as deepen their creative processes – skills which are essential for their future aspirations in the 21st century.

### **E-Journalism**

![Vibes Logo](https://evergreensec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Vibes-Logo.png "Vibes Logo")

The ELDDS E-journalism division, known as **EVG Vibes** in Evergreen, aims to groom student reporters to be excellent writers and drivers of content. The team comprises of student journalists who enjoy producing articles about current events ranging from competitions to the latest activities and programmes in Evergreen. In addition to reporting about events, members write about free topics and create comics. Student journalists do their own research by interviewing people and gathering information online and from print media.

The team is given opportunities to participate in national competitions such as The Media Challenge organised by Republic Polytechnic.   Students get to develop article-writing skills such as understanding newsworthiness and having an eye for detail, and these skills also represent Evergreen as a dynamic and an ever-aspiring institution. Articles produced by students are published as termly newsletters published on the school website and social media platforms.
