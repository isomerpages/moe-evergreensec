<h4><strong>Introduction to NCDCC</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) is a National Uniformed Group under the purview of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore Civil Defence Force.</p>
<p>NCDCC believes in developing and empowering our youths to be active &amp; concerned citizens with life-saving skills. NCDCC began its journey in 2005, with the focus to develop greater awareness of civil defence in our cadets and prepare them with the skills to respond effectively to emergencies at home and abroad. The attitude of readiness against adversity and practical skills which are critical in the face of danger and emergencies, are life-long capabilities that will prove beneficial to our young civil defence ambassadors.</p>
<p><strong>NCDCC Motto</strong><br>NCDCC’s motto of “<strong>We Learn. We Lead. We Serve.</strong>”, is in alignment to the 3 big ideas in Character and Citizenship Education: “Identity, Relationships and Choices”, well encapsulates the journey of NCDCC cadets into three phases:</p>
<p><strong>We Learn</strong><br>Cadets learn Triangle Of Life skills, which include basic firefighting, first aid and CPR+AED. These are core skills in NCDCC, which enable cadets to help themselves and others in times of need. Equipping cadets with these skills will help to form their identity as NCDCC cadets, a community responder at heart.</p>
<p><strong>We Lead</strong><br>Cadets will be trained in soft skills such as leadership, communication (including methods of instruction), relationship management and social awareness to get them ready for their leadership phase. They will also further hone their civil defence skills by going through one of the three cadet specialist tracks and be given leadership opportunities to lead their peers.</p>
<p><strong>We Serve</strong><br>Cadets will make choices to serve their school and the wider community through public education platforms such as the NCDCC Service Month and Emergency Preparedness Day as advocates of Emergency Preparedness. With the civil defence knowledge and skills imparted to them, they will also be able to lend a helping hand as Community First Responders with a compassionate heart.</p>
<p><strong>NCDCC Mascot</strong></p>
<img src="/images/ncdcc0.jpg" style="width: 60%;">
<p>Cadet LeoIn 2016, the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) initiated the creation of NCDCC cadet mascot as part of its rebranding effort in garnering a deeper sense of identity for members of he corps.</p>
<p>The NCDCC masccot, Cadet Leo, was chosen after NCDCC cadets gave their ideas in naming the mascot through a Facebook competition in 2017.</p>
<p>Leo is the Latin word for lion, a symbolic animal for leaders. Charismatic, confident, calm and strong, the lion is also the inspiration behind our nation's name - ""Singapura"", which means ""Lion City"" in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>The NCDCC masacot, Cadet Leo, was officially launched at the NCDCC 12th anniversary parade celebration by Parliamentray Secretary of MOE, Ms Low Yen Ling on 8th April 2017.</p>
