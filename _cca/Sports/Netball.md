The EVG Netball CCA cultivates quick-thinking skills in all players and emphasises the importance of sportsmanship at all times, while striving to develop leaders of character. Through the weekly training sessions, our players are nurtured into independent and responsible young ladies who display grit and tenacity. The fast-paced gameplay requires agility and speed, and develops adaptability through the unexpected court situations. It is a platform where players are able to gain confidence and relish the fruits of their labour.

Netball is a sport where teamwork, respect, resilience are fostered. All members share common goals and strive hard to achieve them, contributing to the camaraderie on and off the court. Rigorous trainings are never dreaded here, as members are constantly spurred on by each other, and as it also allows members to reach and expand their potential.

For members to challenge themselves and hone their skills, the CCA competes in the annual National School Games (NSG) for both the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions. It also takes part in carnivals and tournaments, and organizes friendly games against other schools to acquire exposure and build chemistry between all players.

Team bonding sessions are frequently held to allow teammates to develop friendships and a strong sense of belonging within the team for each individual.

The EVG netball experience is one that will definitely bring about many incredible experiences and unforgettable memories. Through this journey, members forge lifelong friendships, and emerge as better players at the end of their 4 years.
