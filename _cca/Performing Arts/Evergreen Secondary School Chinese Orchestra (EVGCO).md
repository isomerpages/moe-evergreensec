The journey of the Evergreen Chinese Orchestra (EVGCO) began in July 2006. The conductor and many instructors of EVGCO are current members of the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, thereby bringing with them invaluable expertise and knowledge to share with our members. Together with the guidance and support of the teachers-in-charge, EVGCO has matured steadily as a musical group over the years, attaining notable recognition at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations since its inception.
