**Upper Secondary Programme**  
For the Upper Secondary Programme, Design & Technology is offered to the Normal Academic and Express stream students. D&T is a coursework-based subject where students are taught how to do problem-solving through intensive research, tackling their identified problems and solving them through design and make. A theme will be given each year and students have to design their projects relating to the theme.

**Building Design Skills Workshop for D&T students**  
Students went to a workshop organised by Nanyang Polytechnic. During the workshop, the pupils learnt the full suite of topics related to design such as sketching, rendering, soft material modelling, software exposure and 3D printing exposure.
