**EXTERNAL CULINARY COURSE**  
Every year, Secondary 3 Food and Nutrition students are given the opportunity to attend a culinary course conducted by a professional chef. This year we attended the course at Palate Sensations Cooking School where the students learned to make Choux pastry, Pizza and Swiss Roll. The skills learned are in line with the N(A) and O-Level National Examinations requirements and will be useful to create their own interesting and creative dishes for their practical examinations.
