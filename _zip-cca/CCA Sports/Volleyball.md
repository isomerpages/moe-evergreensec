EVG Volleyball aims to develop student athletes who are disciplined and resilient. The CCA is centred on the development of volleyball competencies and character development. Through our vigorous physical trainings, student athletes develop and progress to become robust and competent players with a strong sense of identity and belonging to the school. Our athletes are encouraged to be accomplished holistically â€“ on the volleyball court and in their academia.
