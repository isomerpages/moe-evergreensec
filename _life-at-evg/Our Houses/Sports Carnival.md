#### **The EVG Sports Carnival**

**Closing the School Term on a High Note**

Our EVG Sports Carnival is a celebration of sportsmanship, and unity of our EVGians.

With fun games and activities awaiting at every turn, our EVGians are enticed to push themselves to the limits, all in the name of fun and friendly rivalry.

The Sports Carnival is organised as part of our End-of-Term Activities, and provides a much-needed outlet for our EVGians to channel their competitive spirits and unwind in a healthy, exhilarating way. The joy and exhilaration radiating from their faces were priceless, a testament to the success of the event.

Throughout the carnival, each participant, regardless of their skill level, was encouraged and celebrated, creating an inclusive environment where everyone felt valued and motivated to do their best. The Sports Carnival truly embodies the EVG spirit, nurturing not only physical prowess but also the values of synergy, respect, and leadership.

The EVG Sports Carnival is not just a series of games; it is a platform for personal growth, character development, and the realization of each EVGian's potential.
