Parents, staff, guest runners and EVGians alike embarked on the 3.8 km scenic route, brimming with anticipation and determination. The beautiful surroundings of Gardens by the Bay provided a stunning backdrop for our journey. With each step, our community forged bonds and fostered a sense of camaraderie that epitomizes the EVG spirit.

The EVG Road Run was not just a race; it was a celebration of our resilience, our spirit, and our commitment to growth. It reminded us that together, as one EVG family, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve greatness. The memories we created on that day will serve as a constant reminder of the bonds we share and the limitless potential that lies within us.
