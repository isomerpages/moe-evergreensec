To ensure that students admitted through SCAS will be able to cope with the ITE courses, they are expected to meet the minimum entry requirements (where applicable) of their respective Higher Nitec and Nitec courses based on their GCE ‘N’ or ‘O’ level results. &nbsp;Successful applicants are also expected to pass the colour vision test and/or medical check for admission into selected courses.  
For students who are offered a place via their non-academic achievement in the areas of Sports, Performing &amp; Visual Arts and Leadership, Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation, they will be required to contribute in the same CCA or similar CCA offered at their ITE College of study during their 2 years ITE Course.

**APPLICATION**  
Application is open to final-year secondary school students from the Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic) and ‘O’ level streams, as well as past-year secondary school leavers. &nbsp;Applicants are advised to submit their online application by 26 July 2013, to be considered for admission into the following year's intakes.  
Current ITE students are not eligible for this scheme. Students can apply up to a maximum of 3 choices of courses online. &nbsp;Each ITE College will notify short-listed applicants on the interview dates.

**SELECTION AND OFFER**  
In selecting the students, ITE Colleges will take into account, their suitability and motivation for admission to the course applied for, based on their CCA records, personal portfolio of achievements and performance at interview.  
Final-year secondary school students without their GCE ‘N’ or ‘O’ level examination results, and who are selected, will be given a conditional offer of a place in ITE. &nbsp;Confirmation of admission will be based on students meeting the minimum entry requirements (where applicable) for the selected courses, when the final GCE ‘N’ or ‘O’ level examination results are released. &nbsp;Students, who have applied to more than one ITE College, may receive only 1 offer based on the order of choice.
