**Introduction to Installation Art**  
The Secondary Three Art students were challenged to produce mini-installation pieces that transcended their daily experiences into visual metaphors. Dialogues on artmaking are an integral part of their development as confident artists when they present their works to their friends during the critique session.

**IdentityÂ Project**
