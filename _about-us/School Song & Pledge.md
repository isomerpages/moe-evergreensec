This time of youth, our years at Evergreen  
We learn to be the best that we can be  
To think and care with all our hearts and minds  
We stand as one and together we will shine

Chorus:  
Let's do our best  
In all endeavours  
In Evergreen, we stand as one and together we believe  
We'll give our best  
For our future  
In Evergreen, we Aspire and Achieve

We make this pledge to Evergreen our school  
To take each quest and see it fully through  
To give our school its rightful pride of place  
With enterprise with vision and grace

Chorus:  
Let's do our best  
In all endeavours  
In Evergreen, we stand as one and together we believe  
We'll give our best  
For our future  
To be the best in all that we do

In Evergreen, we Aspire and Achieve  
In Evergreen, we Aspire and Achieve
