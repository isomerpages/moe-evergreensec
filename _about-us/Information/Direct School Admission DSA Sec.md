**Application for DSA-Sec 2023 is open from 4th May to 31st May 2023.**
The application is free-of-charge.
Deadline for 2023 application is 3:00pm, 31 May 2023 (Wednesday).

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent. Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from Year 1 - 4/5.
