## **Fight Dengue**


**WHAT IS DENGUE?**  
Dengue Fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (a more severe form) are the most common mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world. Dengue Fever is spread though the bite of the Aedes Mosquito

**THERE IS NO DRUG FOR DENGUE.**  
To prevent dengue fever, you must prevent the breeding of its carrier, the Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are identified by the black and white stripes on their body. You can get rid of the Aedes mosquito by frequently checking and removing stagnant water in your home.

**LOOK OUT FOR THE BREEDING SITES and DO the 10- minute MOZZIE WIPEOUT!**

**Steps:**  
Step 1, remember to change the water in vases/bowls on alternate days.  
Step 2, always turn over all the water storage containers when not in use.  
Step 3, cover bamboo pole holders when not in use.  
Step 4, clear all blockages and put BTI insecticide in roof gutters monthly.  
Step 5, remove the excess water from flower pot plates on alternate days.
