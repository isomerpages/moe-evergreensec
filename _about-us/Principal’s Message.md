### **Principal’s Message 2023**  

  
**Welcome to 2023!** Our school vision of being “A **dynamic community** that thinks and cares” guides our approach in creating a quality schooling experience for our students.

The school has accomplished much despite the Covid restrictions in the past 3 years.   These include piloting Full Subject Based Banding and implementing the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP).  Most significantly, the teachers had worked tirelessly to ensure the quality and continuous learning of our students throughout the Covid period.   We are very proud that EVGians had shown grit and self-directedness.

Our school’s theme for 2023 is “**Synergy**”.  Synergy means to combine or coordinate to produce a joint effect that is greater than the sum of the parts.  This is a unique characteristic of the Evergreen community.  Together with our partners and parents, we can achieve synergy in three aspects.

**First**, we want to continue to prepare our students for the future.  Our Applied Learning Programmes in Effective Communications has extended beyond the English Language to include the Mother Tongue Languages.  The multi-tiered programmes include in-class and out of class experiences that engage students in language use in various contexts. There are also opportunities for students to go on Overseas Learning Journeys as overseas trips are reinstated.  We will also continue to hone 21st Century Skills in our students through their CCA experiences.  More opportunities will be given to all students to relate to one another as well as to solve problems together.

**Second**, we want to promote a positive learning environment that is uplifting and affirming for all.  EVGians are already known for their caring and discipline dispositions, and these strengths will be further harnessed to create a positive classroom culture where there is care for one another, and a common passion to contribute.  Students will have the opportunities to collaborate with one another through academic and CCA programmes.  They will also be able to plan and implement meaningful projects for the community.

**Third**, we will create quality learning experiences that are engaging and ICT-enabled for all students.  Besides keeping abreast of the latest syllabus development, teachers collaborate within departments and with curriculum experts in MOE to promote the use of technology to empower learning.  In the light of Home-Based Learning, and PDLP, learning has become more blended, and tech-enabled with opportunities for students to access learning at their own time and pace.

As we start the year, I urge every EVGian to make every effort to work with one another, and your teachers, to make learning a positive and fun experience for all.  Remember, **together, we are stronger!**

Mr Vincent Toh

Principal
