### **Principal’s Message 2025**  
 
##### **Exceptionally Evergreen**

2025 will be a very special and joyous year for Evergreen. We will be celebrating our 25th anniversary, marking a quarter of a century of our school’s exceptional journey to becoming a school of choice in the community.

In this spirit, I am excited to share our school theme for the year: “Exceptionally Evergreen.” This theme was intentionally conceptualised to reflect Evergreen’s proud heritage and our aspirations for the future.

After a year of re-envisioning with our community, this theme captures the essence of our new school vision which will inspire our next bound: “Evergreen in Learning, Exceptional in Character.”

“Evergreen in Learning” reflects our commitment to lifelong growth. Like the evergreen tree that stays vibrant in all seasons by refreshing its leaves, we commit ourselves to reinvigorating our teaching and learning practices, nurturing an enduring passion for learning. While the winds of change might be unpredictable, our motivation is enduring- to ensure that our students are equipped with the curiosity, adaptability, and resilience to embrace the opportunities of tomorrow.

“Exceptional in Character” speaks to the heart of who we are as a school. We strongly believe that good learning is rooted in strong values and discipline. We are unrelentingly dedicated to cultivating upstanding students of good character— so they may lead with compassion, contribute meaningfully to their communities, and embody the spirit of excellence in all they do.

Together, “Exceptionally Evergreen” is a rallying call to go to our roots as we strive towards new possibilities. We will be modernising our distinctive National Education roots as the school’s foundation, and challenging ourselves to try to do things  differently to ensure teaching and learning remains future-oriented and effective.

As we take our next leap forward, perhaps most importantly, this is also a reminder to let us all strive to be exceptional in our own ways—whether it is through inspiring others, leading with purpose, or supporting each other as we grow.




A warm welcome to 2024 to everyone! On behalf of the Evergreen Secondary School community, I would first like to express my gratitude to Mr Vincent Toh for his steadfast stewardship of the school. His leadership, and that of our esteemed Principals before him, has established deep foundations of excellence for our school.

I feel privileged to be able to serve alongside the staff of Evergreen, to build on these strong roots. As we embark on this journey together, our school theme for 2024 is “**Our Future of Learning Together**”.

There are three core components to this theme.

1.“**Future**”. While the future can feel daunting, it is also full of possibility. Evergreen’s suite of programmes will continue to ensure EVGians are well-prepared for the future, with 21st Century Competencies infused across the total curriculum. EVGians will enjoy future-oriented opportunities to learn, through programmes such as Overseas Learning Journeys and our Applied Learning Programme, “Effective Communicators with a Heart”. 

2.“**Learning**”. Learning must enable our students, unique in their abilities, to flourish in an uplifting school environment. Our core focus continues to be on providing high quality, student-centric and innovative learning experiences, rooted in Evergreen’s distinct traditions in National Education. Our focus on values and positive discipline shines through our form teachers, CCA groups and platforms like our Learning for Life Programme—”Strengthening Resilience, Character and Leadership through Sports Education.”

3.“**Together**”- The Evergreen Community is at the heart of the school. We have a community of warm staff who take pride in our professionalism and are committed to collaborating to nurture the whole child. Our EVGians show heartwarming care for each other, and seek to contribute to the community. We are also blessed to have supportive parents and partners to journey with us.

Ultimately, under all our efforts, there must be Hope. In a tumultuous world, school is a very special place because it houses the hopes of all of us. As a school, we will continue to support and uplift each other in realising our hopes, and in doing so, Evergreen will continue to grow from strength to strength, season to season.

I truly look forward to our future of learning, together.

Yours Sincerely, Ms Bian Yu Wei
