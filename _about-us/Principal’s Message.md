### **Principal’s Message 2024**  

 
##### **Our Future of Learning Together**



A warm welcome to 2024 to everyone! On behalf of the Evergreen Secondary School community, I would first like to express my gratitude to Mr Vincent Toh for his steadfast stewardship of the school. His leadership, and that of our esteemed Principals before him, has established deep foundations of excellence for our school.

I feel privileged to be able to serve alongside the staff of Evergreen, to build on these strong roots. As we embark on this journey together, our school theme for 2024 is “Our school's theme for 2024 is “**Our Future of Learning Together**”.

There are three core components to this theme.

1.“**Future**”. While the future can feel daunting, it is also full of possibility. Evergreen’s suite of programmes will continue to ensure EVGians are well-prepared for the future, with 21st Century Competencies infused across the total curriculum. EVGians will enjoy future-oriented opportunities to learn, through programmes such as Overseas Learning Journeys and our Applied Learning Programme, “Effective Communicators with a Heart”. 

2.“**Learning**”. Learning must enable our students, unique in their abilities, to flourish in an uplifting school environment. Our core focus continues to be on providing high quality, student-centric and innovative learning experiences, rooted in Evergreen’s distinct traditions in National Education. Our focus on values and positive discipline shines through our form teachers, CCA groups and platforms like our Learning for Life Programme—"Strengthening Resilience, Character and Leadership through Sports Education.”

3.“**Together**”- The Evergreen Community is at the heart of the school. We have a community of warm staff who take pride in our professionalism and are committed to collaborating to nurture the whole child. Our EVGians show heartwarming care for each other, and seek to contribute to the community. We are also blessed to have supportive parents and partners to journey with us.

Ultimately, under all our efforts, there must be Hope. In a tumultuous world, school is a very special place because it houses the hopes of all of us. As a school, we will continue to support and uplift each other in realising our hopes, and in doing so, Evergreen will continue to grow from strength to strength, season to season.

I truly look forward to our future of learning, together.


Yours Sincerely, 
Ms Bian Yu Wei
