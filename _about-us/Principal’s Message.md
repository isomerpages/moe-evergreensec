<h3><strong>Principal’s Message 2026</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Exceptionally Evergreen</strong></h5>
<p>Begin each day with a grateful heart. As we begin 2026, I would like to
express my heartfelt appreciation to all of you for the energy, commitment,
and contributions that made our 25th anniversary year such a meaningful
success. It was a year of reflection, rejoicing, reimagining and shared
pride — one that reminded us of Evergreen’s strong roots and the collective
effort that has shaped our journey over the past quarter century.</p>
<p>We carry forward the theme Exceptionally Evergreen in 2026 because it
continues to reflect both who we are and who we are striving to become.
This is a year of deepening what matters most, and of translating our vision
into purposeful action across the school. Through refreshed programmes,
such as our Applied Learning Programme in Bilingual Communication and our
Digital Literacy and Artificial Intelligence Curriculum, we seek to make
your learning experiences more relevant, engaging, and future-ready.</p>
<p>At the heart of these efforts remains our enduring strength — character
development. You would be aware by now that meaningful learning happens
in a school environment grounded in strong values, discipline, and a sense
of responsibility and respect for others. In 2026, we will anchor our approach
on evidence-based practices, guided by the PRIMED Character Education principles
developed by Dr Marvin Berkowitz. Character is a way of being, and we will
continue to invest in developing Evergreen students who are empowered to
think, feel, and do the right thing.</p>
<p>At Evergreen, we will walk this journey with you as you grow your own
wings. I thank you in advance for playing your part in shaping our school
community, caring for one another, and taking ownership of your holistic
well-being as you navigate the year ahead. Please do not hesitate to reach
out to your teachers should you need any support.</p>
<p></p>
