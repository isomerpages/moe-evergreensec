### EVG Volleyball
	
In EVG Volleyball, we aim to nurture our student's holistic development by instilling our 4 core values in them. These values can be summarised into an acronym, ACES.

A is for Attitude. Through regular training sessions and competitive matches, we aim to cultivate a positive attitude among our students, teaching them to approach challenges with optimism and determination.

C is for Cooperation. Volleyball is a team sport, where 6 players are on court at any one time. Although each player has a slightly different role and skill set, every player counts. Through this, our students learn the significance of teamwork and collaboration, understanding that their individual efforts contribute to the overall success of the team.

E is for Excellence. Our students strive towards constant improvement individually, and together as a team. They are encouraged to push their boundaries, and set high standards for themselves.

Finally, S is for Sportsmanship. We develop our students to be athletes with strong character and values on court, who display dignity in defeat, and humility in victory.

In essence, EVG Volleyball aims to develop well-rounded individuals who possess not only technical proficiency in the sport but also the essential values and character traits necessary for success in various aspects of life.
