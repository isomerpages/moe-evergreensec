The Touch Rugby team, also known as the Warriors, was set up in 2013 to cater to the growing interest among female students to participate in the sport. The CCA aims to develop girls into Champions of Character through values-based sports coaching and where the environment encourages players to take ownership of their team performance.

The Leadership Group in the team compromising of senior players is empowered to take charge of different functions in the team. These include functions such as fitness, skills, and logistics. With guidance and advice from teachers and coaches, players in the team are put in authentic situations where they can learn to practice peer leadership and take initiatives that better serve the team.

The CCA also aims to grow the sport among the local secondary schools by hosting and managing the annual Secondary School Touch Championships (SSTC). The tournament has enjoyed increasing participation from schools every year and contributes to the growth of the sport in the community.
