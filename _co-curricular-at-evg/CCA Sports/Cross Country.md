### EVG Cross Country

Cross-country is a middle-distance running sport of around 3.6-4.8km. The term “cross-country” refers to running across different types of terrain and profile. As an endurance sport, physical conditioning and fitness are very important components. As a result, our student athletes train consistently in varying intensities and volume throughout the year, to ensure they maintain the progress and fitness from season to season.

We are committed in the development of strong, self-motivated and disciplined youths that excel in both sports and studies. We do this during training times when opportunities arise for us provide character coaching, to be influenced by the team’s senior members’ mentorship, and to have fun learning as a team by participating in various enrichment programmes. Our graduates are strong-willed, resilient, and capable young men and women who are selected through the Direct Schools Admission for Junior Colleges (DSA-JC) for their excellence in sports and studies to top JCs in Singapore. Many of them end up as captains of their Cross-Country or Track and Field teams.
