### Rugby

Our Rugby CCA is a platform through which the students  have a greater appreciation of the game and learn important values that will see them through life.

We train twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Over the years, we have taken part in competitions such as National School Games Rugby 'B' and 'C' Division Championships, Singapore Rugby Union 7s, and Saints 7s. There are also various roles and opportunities for students to take up leadership positions in our CCA.
