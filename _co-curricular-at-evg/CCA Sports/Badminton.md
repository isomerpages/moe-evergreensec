### EVG Badminton

Through rigorous training routines, we challenge students to surpass their limits and strive for personal growth. Our diverse range of team and individual events, including friendly matches, school competitions, and external tournaments, provide invaluable exposure and match experience, fostering their competitive spirit and sportsmanship. Recognizing the significance of academic excellence alongside athletic achievement, we go beyond the court to instill a well-rounded mindset.

Collaborating closely with our coach, we inspire students to excel in both their chosen sport and their studies. Together, we aim to build a community that embraces sportsmanship, teamwork, and nurtures future leaders who embody resilience, commitment, and a passion for badminton.

At Evergreen, our goal is to cultivate a competitive spirit and promote sportsmanship among our students. To achieve this, EVG Badminton organizes an annual year-end tournament exclusively for our members. This tournament serves as a platform for students to demonstrate their refined skills and deep passion for badminton. Participants are given the opportunity to register for either the singles or doubles category and form teams according to their preferences. As we celebrated the personal growth of our members at the year-end event in 2022, we presented prizes to acknowledge their accomplishments and motivate them to persistently pursue their dedication to the sport.

As our team continues to grow, our focus is on nurturing student leaders who possess creativity and contribute effectively to the team. In the CCA open house event, all members actively participated and showcased their talents through various creative means, such as designing posters, creating promotional videos, and delivering persuasive speeches to promote Badminton to the Secondary One juniors and parents.

The badminton captains, vice-captains, and executive committee members worked collaboratively to plan and host both the in-house annual year-end tournament and the CCA open house event. These experiences provide valuable leadership 
opportunities for our team leaders, who also serve as role models, inspiring the juniors to develop their own leadership skills.<p></p>
