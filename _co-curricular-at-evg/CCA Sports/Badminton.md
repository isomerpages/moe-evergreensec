<p>EVG Badminton is dedicated to cultivating resilient and committed student
leaders through comprehensive training programs, nurturing their skills
and court craft to unlock their full potential.</p>

<p>Through rigorous training, we challenge students to surpass their limits
and strive for personal growth. Our diverse range of team and individual
events, including friendly matches, school competitions, and external tournaments,
provide invaluable exposure and match experience, fostering their competitive
spirit and sportsmanship. Recognizing the significance of academic excellence
alongside athletic achievement, we go beyond the court to instill a well-rounded
mindset.</p>

<p>Collaborating closely with our coach, we inspire students to excel in
both their chosen sport and their studies. Together, we aim to build a
community that embraces sportsmanship, teamwork, and nurtures future leaders
who embody resilience, commitment, and a passion for badminton.</p>

<p>At Evergreen, our goal is to cultivate a competitive spirit and promote
sportsmanship among our students. To achieve this, EVG Badminton organizes
an annual year-end tournament exclusively for our members. This tournament
serves as a platform for students to demonstrate their refined skills and
deep passion for badminton. Participants are given the opportunity to register
for either the singles or doubles category and form teams according to
their preferences. As we celebrated the personal growth of our members
at the year-end event in 2022, we presented prizes to acknowledge their
accomplishments and motivate them to persistently pursue their dedication
to the sport.</p>

</div>
<p>As our team continues to grow, our focus is on nurturing student leaders
who possess creativity and contribute effectively to the team. In the CCA
Open House event, all members actively participated and showcased their
talents through various creative means, such as designing posters, creating
promotional videos, and delivering persuasive speeches to promote Badminton
to the Secondary One juniors and parents.</p>
<p>The Badminton Captains, Vice-Captains, and Executive Committee members
work collaboratively to plan and host both the in-house annual year-end
tournament and the CCA open house event. These experiences provide valuable
leadership opportunities for our team leaders, who also serve as role models,
inspiring the juniors to develop their own leadership skills.</p>
