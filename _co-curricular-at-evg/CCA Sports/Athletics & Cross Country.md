Evergreen Cross Country as a long-distance running team have grown from strength to strength. Starting out in 2013 with just 13 members, we have grown to a team of more than 50, and accumulated a reputation as one of the strongest in the North Zone. We train hard to run fast, and we expect all our members to put in their very best at trainings and at competitions.

But Cross Country is more than just a CCA, it’s a lifestyle!

On top of training student athletes to become fitter, faster, and healthier, we also provide a holistic development especially in the areas of character, discipline, resilience, and time management. We do so by our unique programme and initiatives such as:

*   Participation in various races throughout the year
*   Weekly team breakfast
*   Focused study sessions
*   Enrichment activities e.g. abseiling, climbing, hiking
*   Training camps
*   Emphasis on healthy lifestyle and good time management

Over the years, our strict training programme has produced good runners, students, and leaders who have gone to fill many positions in the school’s Prefectorial Board, CCA Executive Committee, and scouted by Top JCs in Singapore. In 2018 and 2019, the school’s valedictorians were from Cross Country.

As one of the best Teams in the North Zone, our values and process-driven CCA is suitable for those who want to excel and strive to become a better student athlete. Come and try it to experience it for yourself!
