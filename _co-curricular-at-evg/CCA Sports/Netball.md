<h3>EVG Netball</h3>
<p>The EVG Netball cultivates quick-thinking skills in all players and emphasises
the importance of sportsmanship at all times, while striving to develop
leaders of character. Through the weekly training sessions, our players
are nurtured into independent and responsible young ladies who display
grit and tenacity. The fast-paced gameplay requires agility and speed,
and develops adaptability through the unexpected court situations. It is
a platform where players are able to gain confidence and relish the fruits
of their labour.</p>

<p>Netball is a sport where teamwork, respect, resilience are fostered. All
members share common goals and strive hard to achieve them, contributing
to the camaraderie on and off the court. Rigorous trainings are never dreaded
here, as members are constantly spurred on by each other, and as it also
allows members to reach and expand their potential.</p>

<p>For members to challenge themselves and hone their skills, the CCA competes
in the annual National School Games (NSG) for both the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions.
It also takes part in carnivals and tournaments, and organizes friendly
games against other schools to acquire exposure and build chemistry between
all players.</p>
