<p>The Evergreen Secondary School DMC was formed to provide a platform for
both students and teachers of the school, possessing a wide range of experience
and interests to come together in honing their IT and photography skills
in a myriad of ways. With the overarching vision being a student-centric
Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), the DMC is always on the lookout to give
new opportunities for students to develop themselves holistically, especially
in the area of leadership and character.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers in Charge:</strong> Ms Mindice Yew Min’Er (I/C), Mr Muhd
Amirul B Noor Rahman, Mr Tan Kim Kia, Ms Rachna Arora and Mr Samuel Soong</p>

<p><strong>Life of a Digital Media Club Member</strong>
</p>
<p>The members of DMC can be expected to be challenged to produce storyboards
and express their ideas through animated short stories and videos. Students
will acquire IT skills beyond their classrooms which could be useful for
the working society. At the same time, students who are more inclined towards
photography may specialise and branch out to apply their photography skills
in the pursuit of the art of photography.</p>
<p>Through numerous hands-on activities, enrichment trainings, competitions
and involvement in photography and videography of events, members will
build strong teamwork as well as hone their leadership skills.</p>
<p>The students of Digital Media Club will contribute to the school through
providing video documentation of school events such as the Chinese New
Year Concert, Road Run, Honours Day and National Day Parade and Concert.
Every student-videographer will also build on their communication skills
as they work effectively in camera crew teams so as to overcome challenges
with a positive attitude. At the end of the years of training in the club,
students are expected to have a rich portfolio to showcase their creativity
with confidence.</p>
