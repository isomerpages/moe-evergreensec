**Digital Media Club (DMC)**
![DMC Logo](/images/dmc-logo_white%20(1).jpg)
The Evergreen Secondary School DMC was formed to provide a platform for both students and teachers of the school, possessing a wide range of experience and interests to come together in honing their IT and photography skills in a myriad of ways. With the overarching vision being a student-centric Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), the DMC is always on the lookout to give new opportunities for students to develop themselves holistically, especially in the area of leadership and character.

**Life of a Digital Media Club Member**

The members of DMC can be expected to be challenged to produce storyboards and express their ideas through animated short stories and videos. Students will acquire IT skills beyond their classrooms which could be useful for the working society. At the same time, students who are more inclined towards photography may specialise and branch out to apply their photography skills in the pursuit of the art of photography.

Through numerous hands-on activities, enrichment trainings, competitions and involvement in photography and videography of events, members will build strong teamwork as well as hone their leadership skills. 


The students of Digital Media Club will contribute to the school through providing video documentation of school events such as the Chinese New Year Concert, Road Run, Honours Day and National Day Parade and Concert. Every student-videographer will also build on their communication skills as they work effectively in camera crew teams so as to overcome challenges with a positive attitude. At the end of the years of training in the club, students are expected to have a rich portfolio to showcase their creativity with confidence.
