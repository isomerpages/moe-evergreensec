Marsya 3 RSP, Bernard 3 ITG, Mrs Seah, Debate Teacher-in-charge, Cayden 2 CMT, Lea 2 ETP, Musfirah 3 THK, Joey 2 CMT, Sonia 3 ITG and Samuel 2 CMT during one of the training sessions.

During the unprecedented times in July, two debate teams took on the challenge to participate in the Debate Association Debate Championships (DADC) 2020 which was held online. As a result, all the trainings were a different ball game as face-to-face interactions took a back seat.

It was a true test of the debaters’ grit. However, they rose to the occasion and beat 7 other teams to emerge as Champions of the Silver division. Kudos to these two teams of fighters.

Evergreen Team B emerged as Champions at the Silver Division of DADC 2020 Team B comprised of Bernard 3ITG, Marsya 3 RSP, Musfirah 3 THK and Lea 2 ETP

The Division 3 Debating Championships held in January 2020 was a test of the debaters’ grit and teamwork as they had to participate in three rounds of debate in a day. The debaters would testify that it was a truly enriching experience and a valuable opportunity for dynamic teamwork.

Bernard and Marsya achieved the Best Speaker Award at Rounds 2 and 3 respectively.
