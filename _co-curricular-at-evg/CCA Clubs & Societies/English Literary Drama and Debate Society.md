### **Debate**

Since its inception, the Debate Division has been active in fostering a dynamic debating culture in school. It aims to improve debaters’ general knowledge and sharpen their critical thinking skills. As such, opportunities for its members to represent the school in inter-school debating and oratorical competitions are numerous.

**2021 Achievements**

On 14 August, a team of Sec 1s and 2s participated at the Hua Yi Debate Invitational. It was their first open debate tournament. It was a daunting experience and the students pitted their skills against schools beyond our school cluster.

The young team of debaters are as follows:

1.  HUMARANG SABRINA GABRIELLE SORTIJAS (1 CHR)

Marsya 3 RSP, Bernard 3 ITG, Mrs Seah, Debate Teacher-in-charge, Cayden 2 CMT, Lea 2 ETP, Musfirah 3 THK, Joey 2 CMT, Sonia 3 ITG and Samuel 2 CMT during one of the training sessions.

During the unprecedented times in July, two debate teams took on the challenge to participate in the Debate Association Debate Championships (DADC) 2020 which was held online. As a result, all the trainings were a different ball game as face-to-face interactions took a back seat.

It was a true test of the debaters’ grit. However, they rose to the occasion and beat 7 other teams to emerge as Champions of the Silver division. Kudos to these two teams of fighters.

Evergreen Team B emerged as Champions at the Silver Division of DADC 2020 Team B comprised of Bernard 3ITG, Marsya 3 RSP, Musfirah 3 THK and Lea 2 ETP

The Division 3 Debating Championships held in January 2020 was a test of the debaters’ grit and teamwork as they had to participate in three rounds of debate in a day. The debaters would testify that it was a truly enriching experience and a valuable opportunity for dynamic teamwork.

Bernard and Marsya achieved the Best Speaker Award at Rounds 2 and 3 respectively.

### Drama

The Drama Division aims to inculcate in our students a deep love for the dramatic arts through creative, witty, and impactful performances. We train our students to be comfortable in a variety of public speaking and public performance engagements. Drama members participate in a wide spectrum of school-based performances such as our Chinese New Year Celebrations and National Day Celebrations. Our members also participate in the prestigious Odyssey of the Mind (Singapore), an annual creative problem-solving competition at Anglo Chinese School (Independent) where our members go up against schools like School Of The Arts and Raffles Girls Secondary School. Through these activities, members learn and sharpen their dramatic skills as well as deepen their creative processes – skills which are essential for their future aspirations in the 21st century.
