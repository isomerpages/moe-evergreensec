<p>During the unprecedented times in July, two debate teams took on the challenge
to participate in the Debate Association Debate Championships (DADC) 2020
which was held online. As a result, all the trainings were a different
ball game as face-to-face interactions took a back seat.</p>
<p>It was a true test of the debaters’ grit. However, they rose to the occasion
and beat 7 other teams to emerge as Champions of the Silver division. Kudos
to these two teams of fighters.</p>

rounds of debate in a day. The debaters would testify that it was a truly
enriching experience and a valuable opportunity for dynamic teamwork.</p>
