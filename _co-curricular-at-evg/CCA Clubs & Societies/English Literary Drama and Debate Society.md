During the unprecedented times in July, two debate teams took on the challenge to participate in the Debate Association Debate Championships (DADC) 2020 which was held online. As a result, all the trainings were a different ball game as face-to-face interactions took a back seat.

It was a true test of the debaters’ grit. However, they rose to the occasion and beat 7 other teams to emerge as Champions of the Silver division. Kudos to these two teams of fighters.

Evergreen Team B emerged as Champions at the Silver Division of DADC 2020 Team B comprised of Bernard, Marsya, Musfirah and Lea.

The Division 3 Debating Championships held in January 2020 was a test of the debaters’ grit and teamwork as they had to participate in three rounds of debate in a day. The debaters would testify that it was a truly enriching experience and a valuable opportunity for dynamic teamwork.

Bernard and Marsya achieved the Best Speaker Award at Rounds 2 and 3 respectively.
