From planning and running school-wide events to assisting the school in its day-to-day activities, the prefectorial board takes great pride and responsibility in doing all these well. Formed when the school was in still in its infant years, the board and its members have increasingly taken on greater roles and tasks.

The first few years saw prefects fulfilling duties in supervising students’ movement and discipline. Classroom orderliness and good student behaviour were expected of all the students in the school and the prefects were there to help ensure that these were adhered to. Prefects were also often deployed to assist the school as ushers for guests.

Over the years, the roles and responsibilities of the prefects have expanded, in line with the school’s move to develop and stretch student leaders.

An executive committee is formed from the top student leaders in Secondary 3 to lead the prefectorial board in organising and executing events. Instead of just being ushers, prefects now need to know how to plan, organise, delegate and assume the various roles and responsibilities associated with an event. School-based events such as Secondary One Orientation, Primary Six School Visits and Graduation Day are just a few of the events that greatly involve the prefectorial board.

In addition, prefects are given formal leadership developmental training from external agencies such as Halogen, Achievers and Acorn Training to hone their leadership potential and ability, on top of the constant guidance received from their seniors and teachers.

To date, the prefects are 60-strong and come from very diverse backgrounds and interests. It is in this various mix that the school hopes to develop future leaders for the community.
