<p>From planning and running school-wide events to assisting the school in
its day-to-day activities, the Student Leadership Committee takes great
pride and responsibility in doing all these well. Formed when the school
was still in its infant years, the committee and its members have increasingly
taken on greater roles and tasks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first few years saw prefects fulfilling duties in supervising students’
movement and discipline. Classroom orderliness and good student behaviour
were expected of all the students in the school and the student leaders
were there to help ensure that these were adhered to. Student Leaders were
also often deployed to assist the school as ushers for guests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the years, the roles and responsibilities of the student leaders
have expanded, in line with the school’s move to develop and stretch student
leaders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each year, an Executive Committee is formed from the top student leaders
in Secondary 3 are involved in organising and executing events. Student
leaders plan, organise, delegate and assume the various roles and responsibilities
associated with an event. School-based events such as Secondary One Orientation,
Teachers’ Day and Graduation Day are just a couple of the events that greatly
involve the student leaders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, student leaders are given formal leadership developmental
training from external agencies such as Halogen, Achievers and Acorn Training
to hone their leadership potential and ability, on top of the constant
guidance received from their seniors and teachers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To date, the student leadership committee is 80-strong and comes from
very diverse backgrounds and interests. It is in this various mix that
the school hopes to develop future leaders for the community.</p>

<p>Our school's yearly commitment to Woodlands RC involves contributing numerous
hampers to less privileged families in Woodlands during the Chinese New
Year. This initiative allows our student leaders to engage in meaningful
service, providing support to the community while fostering a sense of
empathy and responsibility. Through this act of giving, they gain valuable
insights into the needs of others and the importance of coming together
to uplift those in need during festive times.</p>

<p>Our student leaders exemplify servant leadership by consistently placing
others before themselves. Through their involvement in numerous Service
Learning projects with Pertapis, Meals on Wheels, SBS Transit and the Singapore
Association of the Visually Handicapped, they have gained invaluable insights
into the importance of serving others. These experiences have broadened
their perspectives, fostering a deep understanding of empathy, selflessness,
and the significance of community service. By embracing these values, they
continue to develop into compassionate leaders dedicated to making a positive
impact on society.</p>
