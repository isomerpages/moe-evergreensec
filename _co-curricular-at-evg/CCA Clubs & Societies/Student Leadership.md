<p>From planning and running school-wide events to assisting the school in
its day-to-day activities, the Prefectorial Board takes great pride and
responsibility in doing all these well. Formed when the school was in still
in its infant years, the board and its members have increasingly taken
on greater roles and tasks.</p>

<p>The first few years saw prefects fulfilling duties in supervising students’
movement and discipline. Classroom orderliness and good student behaviour
were expected of all the students in the school and the prefects were there
to help ensure that these were adhered to. Prefects were also often deployed
to assist the school as ushers for guests.</p>
<p>Over the years, the roles and responsibilities of the prefects have expanded,
in line with the school’s move to develop and stretch student leaders.</p>

<p>Each year, an Executive Committee is formed from the top student leaders
in Secondary 3 are involved in organising and executing events. Student
leaders plan, organise, delegate and assume the various roles and responsibilities
associated with an event. School-based events such as Secondary One Orientation
and Graduation Day are just a couple of the events that greatly involve
the student leaders.</p>

<p>In addition, student leaders are given formal leadership developmental
training from external agencies such as Halogen, Achievers and Acorn Training
to hone their leadership potential and ability, on top of the constant
guidance received from their seniors and teachers.</p>
<p>To date, the student leaders are 60-strong and come from very diverse
backgrounds and interests. It is in this various mix that the school hopes
to develop future leaders for the community.</p>
