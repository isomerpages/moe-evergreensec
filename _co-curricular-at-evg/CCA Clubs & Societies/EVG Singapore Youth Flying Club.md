EVG YFC aims to develop all members holistically throughout their 4 years in this CCA. Students get to experience a whole range of aviation related activities. From lectures aimed at improving their knowledge, to building and flying of model aircraft and visits to RSAF squadrons and airbases; these initiatives help strengthen their interest and forge a deeper understanding in Aviation. Additionally, students can experience joyrides on various RSAF aircraft under the Flight Experience Program (FEP). These include the Lockheed C-130, Fokker 50 and CH-47 Chinook. The FEP also features an experiential ride on the SYFC Diamond DA-40 (for selected outstanding individuals). Currently, we are one of the 17 secondary schools participating in the SYFC CCA programmes and an Open Unit for students from other secondary schools who are keen to learn more on aviation (CCA conducted on Saturday mornings in SYFC).

**Life of an EVG YFC Member**

EVG YFC CCA adopts a model which it develops and trains our members holistically throughout their 4 years in this CCA. Flight Simulation and Launch Glider is fundamental and the first touch point for all members. All Year 1 cadets will undergo a 1 year Fundamental and Experiential Training (FET). Cadetâ€™s Training in Year 1 will be conducted in 3 Phases over the course of 1 year.

All cadets will be allowed to choose their specialization after FET. Members not holding any appointment in the Command Team will be posted to 1 of the Division as their specialization: Radio Control/ Control Line/ Drone. Members are to self regulate their flying hours for Flight Simulation after FET. In the YFC, members are given the opportunity to hone important life skills that encompass skill development, character development and leadership training. This is achieved through numerous experiential learning activities and competitions.
