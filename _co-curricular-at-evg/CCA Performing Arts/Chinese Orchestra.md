**Chinese Orchestra (EVGCO)**

The Evergreen Chinese Orchestra (EVGCO) started in July 2006 with conductor and instructors who are experienced musicians from the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. They have provided valuable expertise and knowledge to the EVGCO members. With the guidance of the teachers and instructors, the EVGCO has grown and gained recognition at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations.

As a multi-racial Performing Arts CCA group, the orchestra emphasizes teamwork, perseverance, positive attitude, and care. Members demonstrate these values through their dedication during practices, striving for excellence and perfection in their individual musical sections, and collaborating harmoniously in all performances.
