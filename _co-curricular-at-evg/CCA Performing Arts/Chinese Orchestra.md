<p>The Evergreen Chinese Orchestra (EVGCO) was created in July 2006 with
a conductor and instructors who are experienced musicians from the Singapore
Chinese Orchestra. They have provided valuable expertise and knowledge
to the EVGCO members. With the guidance of the teachers and instructors,
the EVGCO has grown and gained recognition at the Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentations.</p>
