The journey of the Evergreen Chinese Orchestra (EVGCO) began in July 2006. The conductor and many instructors of EVGCO are current members of the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, thereby bringing with them invaluable expertise and knowledge to share with our members. Together with the guidance and support of the teachers-in-charge, EVGCO has matured steadily as a musical group over the years, attaining notable recognition at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations since its inception.

As a multi-racial Performing Arts CCA group, we work in unison to achieve the best for the orchestra. Our training and developmental programmes allow our members to demonstrate the core values of perseverance, team work, positive attitude and caring in all aspects of their participation in the CCA.Â  With perseverance, members put in dedicated effort in perfecting a score; with teamwork, we are able to weave the various parts of a score into a melodious and harmonious presentation; with a positive mindset, students work hard to excel in their respective musical sections.
