**Chinese Dance**

The Chinese Dance, founded in 2001, was one of the pioneering performing arts in Evergreen Secondary School. It embraces a diverse group of members who share a deep appreciation for Chinese culture and dance. Initially centered around traditional Chinese dance, the troupe has since evolved by incorporating elements of contemporary dance. The synergy of both styles is harmonious and beautiful. It reflects the spirit of the present era and resonates with the ambitions of our youth, who tirelessly pursue a brighter, more promising, and forward-thinking future. This fusion has been incredibly amazing.

**Life of an EVG Chinese Orchestra Member**

The EVG Chinese Dance has graced numerous school events and concerts, including the Chinese New Year and National Day celebrations. Our talents also shine brightly during the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, as well as other competitions and special functions within the community. It is with great pride and gratitude that we are invited to perform at the prestigious 2023 Labour Day Istana Open House. The performance took place at the Ceremonial Plaza, set against the majestic backdrop of the Istana Main Building.

As a closely-knit family of dedicated dancers, we continuously strive to give our utmost on the stage, embracing hard work and perseverance as our guiding principles.
