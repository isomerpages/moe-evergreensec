<p>In 2009, a Guitar Ensemble was introduced as a fresh Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) at Evergreen Secondary School in response to the growing interest
exhibited by a group of our students. These individuals demonstrated a
genuine passion for playing the guitar, often found strumming during breaks
and after school hours.</p>
<p>Our primary goal is to nurture a closely-knit and cohesive CCA that fosters
creativity and excellence in music. We aspire to create an environment
that cultivates a deep appreciation for the art of guitar playing. To achieve
this, we offer our members the opportunity to develop their musical talents
and to experience the sheer joy of creating, understanding, and sharing
music through the guitar. Furthermore, we aim to foster a strong sense
of camaraderie among all members.</p>

<p><strong>Life of a Guitar Ensemble Member</strong>
</p>
<p>We aim to elevate our guitar skills, expand our musical knowledge, and
foster a lifelong passion for music that extends well beyond our time in
school. Our practice sessions allow us to hone our abilities and encourage
us to express our creativity and delve into a wide range of music genres
and styles. We strive to develop our own distinct musical voices and embracing
the uniqueness that each member brings to the ensemble.</p>
<p>Our members engage in various enriching experiences like participating
in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, the inter-school
exchange programs, and the MOE CCA Music Camp. We also actively organize
concerts and competitions within our school and in the community. These
opportunities not only allow us to gain valuable performance experience
but also build our confidence and leadership skills. By immersing ourselves
in these endeavors, we grow as musicians and individuals, creating harmonious
melodies together and continuously pushing the boundaries of our capabilities.</p>
