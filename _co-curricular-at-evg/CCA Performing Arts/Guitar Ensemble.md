**Guitar Ensemble**

![](/images/g3%20syf%202023.jpeg)

In 2009, a Guitar Ensemble was introduced as a fresh Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) at Evergreen Secondary School in response to the growing interest exhibited by a group of our students. These individuals demonstrated a genuine passion for playing the guitar, often found strumming during breaks and after school hours.

Our primary goal is to nurture a closely-knit and cohesive CCA that fosters creativity and excellence in music. We aspire to create an environment that cultivates a deep appreciation for the art of guitar playing. To achieve this, we offer our members the opportunity to develop their musical talents and to experience the sheer joy of creating, understanding, and sharing music through the guitar. Furthermore, we aim to foster a strong sense of camaraderie among all members.

**Life of a Guitar Ensemble Member**

We aim to elevate our guitar skills, expand our musical knowledge, and foster a lifelong passion for music that extends well beyond our time in school. Our practice sessions allow us to hone our abilities and encourage us to express our creativity and delve into a wide range of music genres and styles. We strive to develop our own distinct musical voices and embracing the uniqueness that each member brings to the ensemble.

Our members engage in various enriching experiences like participating in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, the inter-school exchange programs, and the MOE CCA Music Camp. We also actively organize concerts and competitions within our school and in the community. These opportunities not only allow us to gain valuable performance experience but also build our confidence and leadership skills. By immersing ourselves in these endeavors, we grow as musicians and individuals, creating harmonious melodies together and continuously pushing the boundaries of our capabilities.
