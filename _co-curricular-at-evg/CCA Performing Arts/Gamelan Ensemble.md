<p>The Gamelan Ensemble provides opportunities for students to learn to play
various traditional instruments like the demung, kethuk, gendang, bonang
and others. Our members play the gamelan instruments using the dual tuning
system which ranges from a seven-tone scale with irregular intervals in
between or a five-tone scale with equal intervals from one note to another.</p>
<p>Our members demonstrate high level of self-discipline and focus as they
take cues and listen to the notes played by other team members, creating
harmonious melodies together. Teamwork is therefore the key to the success
of the CCA.</p>
<p>The EVG Gamelan Ensemble has been invited to perform within school and
in the communities.</p>

<p><strong>Life of a Gamelan Ensemble Member</strong>
</p>
<p>During practice sessions, members develop the skills to play various instruments
through rotation. At the end of an academic year, all members are proficient
to play two or more instruments.</p>
<p>Members are empowered to organise events and performances. They will be
assigned various roles to develop their level of confidence as well as
their leadership, communication and project management skills.</p>
<p>The EVG Gamelan Ensemble reaches out to the community by performing at
numerous locations such as the National Library branch, community centres
and open space at Kampung Admiralty.</p>
