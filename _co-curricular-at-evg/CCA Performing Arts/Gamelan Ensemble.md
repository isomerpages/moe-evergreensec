**Gamelan Ensemble**

![](/images/gamelan1.jpg)

The Gamelan Ensemble provides opportunities for students to learn to play various traditional instruments like the demung, kethuk, gendang, bonang and others. Our members play the gamelan instruments using the dual tuning system which ranges from a seven-tone scale with irregular intervals in between or a five-tone scale with equal intervals from one note to another.

Our members demonstrate high level of self-discipline and focus as they take cues and listen to the notes played by other team members, creating harmonious melodies together. Teamwork is therefore the key to the success of the CCA.

The EVG Gamelan Ensemble has been invited to perform within school and in the communities.

**Life of a Gamelan Ensemble Member**

During practice sessions, members develop the skills to play various instruments through rotation. At the end of an academic year, all members are proficient to play two or more instruments.

Members are empowered to organise events and performances. They will be assigned various roles to develop their level of confidence as well as their leadership, communication and project management skills.

The EVG Gamelan Ensemble reaches out to the community by performing at numerous locations such as the National Library branch, community centres and open space at Kampung Admiralty.
