**Life of a Malay Dance Member**

Sukma Irama specialises in traditional malay dance. Our dancers will master the 5 basic traditional Malay dance moves – Asli, Inang, Joget, Masri & Zapin. Dancers will be given the opportunity to showcase their talents during school events and in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). Malay Dance also collaborated with other performing Arts CCA in EVG such as Gamelan & Chinese Dance. Our dancers have the autonomy to choose and organise team-bonding & VIA activities.
