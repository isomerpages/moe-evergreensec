‘Sway to The Rhythm’ is the motto of **Sukma Irama EVG Malay Dance Club**. 

Founded in 2004, Sukma Irama provided the platform for dancers to develop their skills in Malay dance and develop the confidence to display different forms of performances to diverse group of audience in school and beyond. Apart from grooming young talents, our Malay Dance Club also aims to instil our dancers with good values and character through our enrichment and VIA activities.

**Life of a Malay Dance Member**

Sukma Irama specialises in traditional Malay dance. Our dancers will master the 5 basic dance moves – Asli, Inang, Joget, Masri & Zapin. 

Dancers will be given the opportunity to showcase their talents at school events and the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Performance. The Malay Dance also collaborates with other Performing Arts CCAs in EVG such as the Gamelan Ensemble and the Chinese Dance. Our dancers also have the autonomy to choose and organise team-bonding and VIA activities.
