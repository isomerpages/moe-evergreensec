‘Sway to The Rhythm’ is the motto of **Sukma Irama EVG Malay Dance Club**. 

Founded in 2004, Sukma Irama provided the platform for dancers to develop their skills in Malay dance and develop the confidence to display different forms of performances to diverse group of audience in school and beyond. Apart from grooming young talents, our Malay Dance Club also aims to instil our dancers with good values and character through our enrichment and VIA activities.
