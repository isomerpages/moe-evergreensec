**The mission and vision of the CCA**

The Youth Flying Club (YFC) in Evergreen Secondary School was formed in 2003. To date, the total strength has grown to more than 150 members.

YFC, in collaboration with the Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC), aims to promote an interest in aviation and to develop a passion for flying through aeromodelling.

**How does the CCA develop its students and talents? How does the CCA develop its leaders?**

In the YFC, cadets are given the opportunity to hone important life skills that encompass skill development, character development and leadership training. This is achieved through numerous experiential learning activities and competitions.

**SYFC Leadership Programme**

Potential leaders are given leadership positions to hone their communication and decision-making skills.

These leaders are selected to attend Junior Aviators’ Course, Flight Leaders’ Course and SWIFT Instructor’s Course conducted at SYFC.

**The most defining experience for a student in YFC**

A SYFC member will experience drone-flying, glider-building and enjoy joyrides in various aeroplanes. For students who have aspirations to seek a career in aviation, this CCA provides exposure and foundational skills.
