**Club Description**

The Evergreen Secondary School Interact Club is a Rotary Club of Suntec City sponsored service club. Rotary is an organization for schools all around the world to help students get involved in leadership and service. Interact, which stands for “International Action”, is a club for young students to fully maximize their potential as a person. It enables students to interact more with the society and initiate as well as galvanize others to take part community involvement programmes. This in turn opens up students’ eyes to the world of the less privileged and broadens their horizons. It is a club where everyone is a leader passionate to serve both school and community, where students put “Service Above Self”.

The club is led by a Board of Directors who take charge of 4 main areas of service – namely International Understanding, Club Service, Community Service and Club Administration. In addition, Interactors choose to be part of a Service Committee that researches, plans, conducts and carries out a Mass VIA Service Learning project. Through this project, Interactors develop leadership skills as they have to lead both club members as well as schoolmates from other CCAs who partner with Interact in carrying out the projects. As part of the school VIA programme, Interact Club will also offer opportunities for selected classes and students to adopt projects and partner with the club in carrying out projects. In addition, club members have the opportunity to take part in activities that showcase their talents and stretch their limits such as awareness campaigns in school as well as musical performances to generate interest and awareness for causes. Interactors undergo training in servant leadership, as well as venture out of school on learning journeys to be exposed to how other organisations and schools serve the community. Besides this, Interact Club of Evergreen Secondary also collaborates with our sister club Greendale Secondary, the Rotary Club of Suntec City and North West CDC and Woodlands Zone 2 on various community programmes. Rotary Club of Suntec City also offers our Interactors the opportunity to take part in job attachment programmes with members of the Rotary. In return, our Interactors support the Rotary Club in their annual Installation ceremony as well as Rotary ad hoc programmes. Hence, Interactors will have the prospect opportunities to be involved in activities and partnerships with Interactors from these schools and external organisations. This will allow them to be exposed to situations they do not encounter in their everyday lives and develop a network of friendships with others.

**Club Activities**

As part of our regular service for each level, the Interactors take part in signature programmes such as:

1.  Job Shadowing Programmes with Rotary Club partners (School Holidays)
2.  Fundraising for causes such as the End Polio Project

6.  Homework Support Programme in collaboration with Marsiling Primary School
7.  Service Learning in collaboration with various partners (ad-hoc)
8.  Leadership Development Training in Community Development

Through these projects, Interactors are given many opportunities to learn the skills of interacting with different groups of people through various activities and components of community service. The Evergreen Interact Club is for youths who are keen in making a difference to other people, making them feel happy and touching their hearts through service.

**Board of Directors Leadership Development Programme**

In addition to the above programmes, the BODs will have the opportunity to represent the club at Rotary events such as the Chinese New Year Rotary gathering as well as National Day Dinner.
