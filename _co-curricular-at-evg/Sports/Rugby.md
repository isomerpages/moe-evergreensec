**Our Mission:** _Transforming boys into sportsmen, gentlemen_

**Our Vision:** _Champions at heart, Gentlemen in life_

Our coaches are certified coaches from Singapore Rugby Union (SRU) with Level 2 certification who have experience in training the national teams. We also seek opportunities to partner with SRU and visiting foreign players to run coaching clinics.

We believe in training each player holistically. Apart from physical training, we also look into the players’ welfare, academic support and socio-emotional development.

We train all players to be leaders in their own right. The most defining experience for our boys is to be able to train and represent the school in the National Schools 15s tournament as it brings the team together and brings out the best in them.
